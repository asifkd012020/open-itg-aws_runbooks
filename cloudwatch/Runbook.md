## Overview
Amazon CloudWatch monitors your Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources and the applications you run on AWS in real time. You can use CloudWatch to collect and track metrics, which are variables you can measure for your resources and applications.
The CloudWatch home page automatically displays metrics about every AWS service you use. You can additionally create custom dashboards to display metrics about your custom applications, and display custom collections of metrics that you choose. You can create alarms that watch metrics and send notifications or automatically make changes to the resources you are monitoring when a threshold is breached. For example, you can monitor the CPU usage and disk reads and writes of your Amazon EC2 instances and then use this data to determine whether you should launch additional instances to handle increased load. You can also use this data to stop under-used instances to save money. With CloudWatch, you gain system-wide visibility into resource utilization, application performance, and operational health.

## Preventative Controls

### 1. CloudWatch IAM Policy Enforce Least Priviledge for CloudWatch Resources
IAM is one of the primary controls available to control access to the CloudWatch service, and as such this section details the current CG implementation of IAM controls on the service. AWS does not currently support resource or tag based authorization to the CloudWatch service, our main IAM controls will be focused on Identity-Based Policy.
<br>

**NIST CSF:**
|NIST Subcategory Control|Description|
|-----------|------------------------|
|PR.AC-1|Identities and credentials are issued, managed, verified, revoked, and audited for authorized devices, users and processes|
|PR.AC-3|Remote access is managed|
|PR.AC-4|Access permissions and authorizations are managed, incorporating the principles of least privilege and separation of duties|
|PR.AC-6|Identities are proofed and bound to credentials and asserted in interactions|
|PR.AC-7|Users, devices, and other assets are authenticated (e.g., single-factor, multi-factor) commensurate with the risk of the transaction (e.g., individuals’ security and privacy risks and other organizational risks)|
<br>

**Capital Group:**
|Control Statement|Description|
|------|----------------------|
|5|AWS IAM User accounts are only to be created for use by services or products that do not support IAM Roles. Services are not allowed to create local accounts for human use within the service. All human user authentication will take place within CG’s Identity Provider.|
|8|AWS IAM User secrets, including passwords and secret access keys, are to be rotated every 90 days. Accounts created locally within any service must also have their secrets rotated every 90 days.|
|10|Administrative access to AWS resources will have MFA enabled|
<br>

**Why?**<br>
Identity-based policies are very powerful. They determine whether someone can create, access, or delete CloudWatch resources in your account. Since the first cloud deployment in AWS, CG has standardized our enabling of CloudWatch and forwarding to splunk for use. This enables Operations, Application and Security teams to quickily be able to monitor our systems for issues. IAM is a critical component in this process, allowing the appropriate granular access to each individual or team that requires access to the service.

**How?**<br>
Creating Identity-based policy for CloudWatch should take into account a few items, including: AWS Account, The Team and data sensitivity. This section will focus on the permissions required by Administrators, Developers and other teams. Assigning permissions on a granular basis based on role will allow CG to maintain least priviledge needed for users to perform their duties.

1. **CloudWatch Administrator Policy**<br>
Administrators of the CloudWatch service require full permissions as they will need to perform functions such as creating and deleting trails. CG's current policy enables administrators through our *"AdminPermissionBoundary"* policy.

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": [
        "cloudwatch:*"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

2. **Editor Role Policy**<br>
Developers will require CloudWatch service permissions to Describe, list or put metric data and other similar actions to the CloudWatch service, but will not have permissions to affect the status of the service itself. CG's policy that allows for Edit permissions is *"EditPermissionsBoundary"*. The following policy is an example policy for Developers:

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": [
        "cloudwatch:PutMetricData",
        "cloudwatch:Describe*",
        "cloudwatch:Get*",
        "cloudwatch:List*"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

3. **Read-Only Role Policy**
Users who require read-only access to the CloudWatch service will only have access to permissions such as Describe, list etc. CG's current policy allowing this level of access is the *"ReadPermissionsBoundary"* Role Policy.

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": [
        "cloudwatch:Describe*",
        "cloudwatch:Get*",
        "cloudwatch:List*"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Capital Group Glossory
**Data** - Digital pieces of information stored or transmitted for use with an information system from which understandable information is derived. Items that could be considered to be data are: Source code, meta-data, build artifacts, information input and output.  
 
**Information System** - An organized assembly of resources and procedures for the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information. All systems, platforms, compute instances including and not limited to physical and virtual client endpoints, physical and virtual servers, software containers, databases, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, network devices, applications (internal and external), Serverless computing instances (i.e. AWS Lambda), vendor provided appliances, and third-party platforms, connected to the Capital Group network or used by Capital Group users or customers.

**Log** - a record of the events occurring within information systems and networks. Logs are composed of log entries; each entry contains information related to a specific event that has occurred within a system or network.

**Information** - communication or representation of knowledge such as facts, data, or opinions in any medium or form, including textual, numerical, graphic, cartographic, narrative, or audiovisual. 

**Cloud computing** - A model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

**Vulnerability**  - Weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat source. Note: The term weakness is synonymous for deficiency. Weakness may result in security and/or privacy risks.
