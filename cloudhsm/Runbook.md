## Overview
AWS and AWS partners offer various options such as AWS KMS to protect your data in AWS. However, due to contractual, regulatory compliance, or CG Standards for security of an application or sensitive data, you might need additional protection. AWS CloudHSM is a cloud-based dedicated, single-tenant HSM allowing you to include secure key storage and high-performance crypto operations to your applications on the AWS platform. It enables you to securely generate, store, manage, and protect encryption keys in a way that these keys are accessible only by you or authorized users that only you specify and no one else.

AWS CloudHSM is a fully managed service that takes care of administrative, time-consuming tasks such as backups, software updates, hardware provisioning, and high availability by automating these tasks. However, AWS does not have any access to configure, create, manage, or use your CloudHSM. You can quickly scale by adding or removing HSM capacity on-demand with no upfront costs.

Although CloudHSM is the most secure mechanism for controlling access to and storage of encryption material, it also does not directly integrate with most of the AWS services out the box.  This should be taken into account when considdering the use of CloudHSM.

When you choose to use AWS CloudHSM, you can perform a variety of cryptographic tasks, including:
- Generate, store, import, export, and manage cryptographic keys, including symmetric keys and asymmetric key pairs.
- Use symmetric and asymmetric algorithms to encrypt and decrypt data.
- Use cryptographic hash functions to compute message digests and hash-based message authentication codes (HMACs).
- Cryptographically sign data (including code signing) and verify signatures.
- Generate cryptographically secure random data.

**NOTE:** *When using CloudHSM, one should realize that CG's Encryption standards require the generation of all new Encryption Material to be done on CG's on-premesis HSM clusters.  Cloud HSM clusters should only be used to store and provide access to Encryption Material securely imported from these on-premesis clusters.*

## Capital Group Glossory 
**Data** - Digital pieces of information stored or transmitted for use with an information system from which understandable information is derived. Items that could be considered to be data are: Source code, meta-data, build artifacts, information input and output.  
 
**Information System** - An organized assembly of resources and procedures for the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information. All systems, platforms, compute instances including and not limited to physical and virtual client endpoints, physical and virtual servers, software containers, databases, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, network devices, applications (internal and external), Serverless computing instances (i.e. AWS Lambda), vendor provided appliances, and third-party platforms, connected to the Capital Group network or used by Capital Group users or customers.

**Log** - a record of the events occurring within information systems and networks. Logs are composed of log entries; each entry contains information related to a specific event that has occurred within a system or network.

**Information** - communication or representation of knowledge such as facts, data, or opinions in any medium or form, including textual, numerical, graphic, cartographic, narrative, or audiovisual. 

**Cloud computing** - A model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

**Vulnerability**  - Weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat source. Note: The term weakness is synonymous for deficiency. Weakness may result in security and/or privacy risks.
