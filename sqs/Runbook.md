## Overview
Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. SQS eliminates the complexity and overhead associated with managing and operating message oriented middleware, and empowers developers to focus on differentiating work. Using SQS, you can send, store, and receive messages between software components at any volume, without losing messages or requiring other services to be available.

SQS offers two types of message queues. Standard queues offer maximum throughput, best-effort ordering, and at-least-once delivery. SQS FIFO queues are designed to guarantee that messages are processed exactly once, in the exact order that they are sent.

### Features & Benefits
 - Eliminate administrative overhead
 - Reliably deliver messages
 - Keep sensitive data secure
 - Scale elastically and cost-effectively

### 1. SQS Utilizes VPC Endpoints to Prevent Public Access
Following CG's stringent cloud security controls, you should establish a private connection between your VPC and SQS. You can use this connection to enable SQS to communicate with your resources on your VPC without going through the public internet.

<br>

**Why?**<br>
CG has stringent cloud security controls around how services need to be secured, so that they are not publicly accessible. One of the ways to ensure that a service is only accessible to CG networks is to deploy the service using VPC Interface Endpoints.

**How?**<br>

When establishing a private connection between your virtual private cloud (VPC) and the Amazon SQS service, you should create an interface VPC endpoint. You can use this connection to call the Amazon SQS service from your VPC without sending traffic over the Internet. The endpoint provides secure connectivity to the Amazon SQS service without requiring an Internet gateway (IGW), NAT instance, or virtual private network (VPN) connection.

Interface VPC endpoints are powered by AWS PrivateLink, a feature that enables private communication between AWS services using private IP addresses. To use AWS PrivateLink, create an interface VPC endpoint for Amazon SQS in your VPC using the Amazon VPC console, API, or CLI. Doing this creates an elastic network interface in your subnet with a private IP address that serves Amazon SQS requests. You can also access a VPC endpoint from on-premises environments or from other VPCs using AWS VPN, AWS Direct Connect, or VPC peering. 

 - **NOTE:** `You can use Amazon Virtual Private Cloud only with HTTPS Amazon SQS endpoints.`<br>

### Below are the steps to implement Interface VPC Endpoints for SQS:
<br>

**Creation of Interface VPC Endpoint:**
  1. Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/, and choose Endpoints from the navigation pane at left.
  2. Choose Create Endpoint.
     - For Service category, choose AWS service. 
     - For Service Name, choose Config in your AWS Region (for example, `com.amazonaws.us-east-1.sqs`).
     - Then choose the VPC, if it does not already exist follow this [link](https://github.com/open-itg/aws_runbooks/blob/master/vpc/RUNBOOK.md) for instructions on how to create a new VPC. 
     - Select a security group for AWS Config, if the default security group will not suffice then follow this [link](https://github.com/open-itg/aws_runbooks/blob/master/vpc/RUNBOOK.md) for instructions on how to create a new Security Group. 
     - Make sure that you `Enable` the Enable Private DNS Name check box.
     - Now add the appropriate `CG standard tags`.
  3. Click `Create Endpoint` to complete the process.
  4. The SQS service will now be accessible via the private endpoint for all requests within the VPC.
<br><br>

**Creation of strict VPC Endpoint Policy:**<br>
Once we have setup a VPC Endpoint, we still need to mandate the use of the VPC Endpoint. Enforcement takes the form of a custom VPC Endpoint policy as seen below:

  1. Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/, and choose Endpoints from the navigation pane at left.
  2. Select the Endpoint created in the previous step for `SQS`.
  3. Click on the `Policy Tab`, and edit the policy.
  4. Enter the policy information in the policy field, based on the example below, with the appropriate modifications. where `11111111111` is the AWS account and `vpce-2222222` is the VPC Endpoint.

            }
         }
      }
   ]
}
