## Detective
### 1. Amazon Redshift should have automatic upgrades to major versions enabled

**Why?** 
This control checks whether automatic major version upgrades are enabled for the Amazon Redshift cluster\.

Enabling automatic major version upgrades ensures that the latest major version updates to Amazon Redshift clusters are installed during the maintenance window\. These updates might include security patches and bug fixes\. Keeping up-to-date with patch installation is an important step in securing systems\.

**How?** 
Enable RDS auto minor version upgrades\.

To enable this option from the AWS CLI, use the Amazon Redshift modify-cluster command to set the --allow-version-upgrade attribute\.

aws redshift modify-cluster --cluster-identifier clustername --allow-version-upgrade
Where clustername is the name of your Amazon Redshift cluster\.
