## Overview
Amazon SageMaker is a fully-managed service that enables data scientists and developers to quickly and easily build, train, and deploy machine learning models at any scale. Amazon SageMaker includes modules that can be used together or independently to build, train, and deploy your machine learning models.

### Key Features
  - The first integrated development environment (IDE) for ML
  - Build, train, and tune models automatically
  - Reduce data labeling costs by up to 70%
  - The fastest and easiest way to prepare data for ML
  - Purpose-built feature store for ML
  - One-click deployment to the cloud
  - Secure your data and code throughout the ML lifecycle

## Preventative Controls
<img src="/docs/img/Prevent.png" width="50">

### 1. SageMaker Utilizes VPC Endpoints to Prevent Public Access
SageMaker currently supports VPC Interface Endpoints in AWS, and as such allows the service to meet CG's stringent Public Access control requirements.
<br>

**NIST CSF:** <br>

|NIST Subcategory Control|Description|
|-----------|------------------------|
|PR.PT-4|Communications and control networks are protected|
|PR.PT-5|Mechanisms (e.g., failsafe, load balancing, hot swap) are implemented to achieve resilience requirements in normal and adverse situations|
|PR.AC-3|Remote access is managed|
|PR.AC-5|Network integrity is protected (e.g., network segregation, network segmentation)|
<br>

**Capital Group:** <br>

|Control Statement|Description|
|------|----------------------|
|6|Any AWS service used by CG should not be directly available to the Internet and the default route is always the CG gateway.|
|7|Use of AWS IAM accounts are restricted to CG networks.|
<br>

**Why?**<br>
SageMaker is a service that allows AWS hosted applications and services to securely retrieve passwords at runtime, thus preventing unauthorized disclosure preventing the need to store passwords in clear. Due to passwords being classified as sensitive, We need to make sure that this traffic is not transmitted or accessible over the Public Internet. 
<br>

**How?**<br>
Establishing a private connection between your virtual private cloud (VPC) and the Amazon SageMaker service, you should create an interface VPC endpoint. You can use this connection to call the Amazon SageMaker service from your VPC without sending traffic over the Internet. The endpoint provides secure connectivity to the Amazon SageMaker service without requiring an Internet gateway (IGW), NAT instance, or virtual private network (VPN) connection.

Interface VPC endpoints are powered by AWS PrivateLink, a feature that enables private communication between AWS services using private IP addresses. To use AWS PrivateLink, create an interface VPC endpoint for Amazon SageMaker in your VPC using the Amazon VPC console, API, or CLI. Doing this creates an elastic network interface in your subnet with a private IP address that serves Amazon SageMaker requests. You can also access a VPC endpoint from on-premises environments or from other VPCs using AWS VPN, AWS Direct Connect, or VPC peering.

Below are the steps to implement Interface VPC Endpoints for SageMaker:

**Creation of Interface VPC Endpoint:**
  1. Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/, and choose Endpoints from the navigation pane at left.
  2. Choose Create Endpoint.
     - For Service category, choose AWS service. 
     - For Service Name, choose Config in your AWS Region (for example, `com.amazonaws.us-east-1.sagemaker`).
     - Then choose the VPC, if it does not already exist follow this [link](https://github.com/open-itg/aws_runbooks/blob/master/vpc/RUNBOOK.md) for instructions on how to create a new VPC. 
     - Select a security group for AWS Config, if the default security group will not suffice then follow this [link](https://github.com/open-itg/aws_runbooks/blob/master/vpc/RUNBOOK.md) for instructions on how to create a new Security Group. 
     - Make sure that you `Enable` the Enable Private DNS Name check box.
     - Now add the appropriate `CG standard tags`.
  4. Click `Create Endpoint` to complete the process.
  5. The SageMaker service will now be accessible via the private endpoint for all requests within the VPC.

**Create a VPC Endpoint Policy for SageMaker:**<br>
VPC Endpoint Policy allows the owner to limit access to SageMaker, and thus enabling least privilege access to SageMaker can be achieved through VPC Endpoint Policy.

You can create a policy for Amazon VPC endpoints for SageMaker to specify the following:
  - The principal that can perform actions.
  - The actions that can be performed.
  - The resources on which actions can be performed.

**Example:** *Policy allowing all users who have access to the VPC interface endpoint the ability to invoke the SageMaker hosted endpoint named `myEndpoint`.*
```
{
  "Statement": [
      {
          "Action": "sagemaker:InvokeEndpoint",
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Resource": "arn:aws:sagemaker:us-west-2:123456789012:endpoint/myEndpoint",
          "Principal": "*"
      }
  ]
}
```






## Encrypt data at rest using CG KMS -- ** Sentinel policy check **
## Use service endpoints to route via private network
## Disable Internet (public) access -- ** Sentinel policy check **
## Ensure workloads execute in private network -- ** SCP Policy **
## Set source code repository to CG's instance of GitHub Enterprise

### SageMaker Notebook Instance and SageMaker Domain Sentinel Policies have been defined to verify SageMaker configuration.  The policies check that appropirate encryption and network controls are in place for SageMaker.  You will find details at the following link.
