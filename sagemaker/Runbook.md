## Cloud Security Requirements
<img src="/docs/img/Prevent.png" width="50">

### 1. SageMaker Utilizes VPC Endpoints to Prevent Public Access
SageMaker currently supports VPC Interface Endpoints in AWS, and as such allows the service to meet CG's stringent Public Access control requirements.

<br>

**Why?**<br>
SageMaker is a service that data scientists and developers can quickly and easily build and train machine learning models, and then directly deploy them into a production-ready hosted environment. As the users may be working with sensitive data, We need to make sure that this traffic is not transmitted or accessible over the Public Internet. 
<br>

**How?**<br>
Establishing a private connection between your virtual private cloud (VPC) and the Amazon SageMaker service, you should create an interface VPC endpoint. You can use this connection to call the Amazon SageMaker service from your VPC without sending traffic over the Internet. The endpoint provides secure connectivity to the Amazon SageMaker service without requiring an Internet gateway (IGW), NAT instance, or virtual private network (VPN) connection.

Interface VPC endpoints are powered by AWS PrivateLink, a feature that enables private communication between AWS services using private IP addresses. To use AWS PrivateLink, create an interface VPC endpoint for Amazon SageMaker in your VPC using the Amazon VPC console, API, or CLI. Doing this creates an elastic network interface in your subnet with a private IP address that serves Amazon SageMaker requests. You can also access a VPC endpoint from on-premises environments or from other VPCs using AWS VPN, AWS Direct Connect, or VPC peering. 

<img src="/docs/img/sagemaker/vpce_use.png" width="600"/>

Below are the steps to implement Interface VPC Endpoints for SageMaker:

**Creation of Interface VPC Endpoint:**
  1. Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/, and choose Endpoints from the navigation pane at left.
  2. Choose Create Endpoint.
     - For Service category, choose AWS service. 
     - For Service Name, choose Config in your AWS Region (for example, `com.amazonaws.us-east-1.sagemaker`).
     - Then choose the VPC, if it does not already exist follow this [link](https://github.com/open-itg/aws_runbooks/blob/master/vpc/RUNBOOK.md) for instructions on how to create a new VPC. 
     - Select a security group for AWS Config, if the default security group will not suffice then follow this [link](https://github.com/open-itg/aws_runbooks/blob/master/vpc/RUNBOOK.md) for instructions on how to create a new Security Group. 
     - Make sure that you `Enable` the Enable Private DNS Name check box.
     - Now add the appropriate `CG standard tags`.
  4. Click `Create Endpoint` to complete the process.
  5. The SageMaker service will now be accessible via the private endpoint for all requests within the VPC.

**Create a VPC Endpoint Policy for SageMaker:**<br>
VPC Endpoint Policy allows the owner to limit access to SageMaker, and thus enabling least privilege access to SageMaker can be achieved through VPC Endpoint Policy.

You can create a policy for Amazon VPC endpoints for SageMaker to specify the following:
  - The principal that can perform actions.
  - The actions that can be performed.
  - The resources on which actions can be performed.

**Example Policy:** <br>
*Policy allowing all users who have access to the VPC interface endpoint the ability to invoke the SageMaker hosted endpoint named `myEndpoint`.*
```
{
  "Statement": [
      {
          "Action": "sagemaker:InvokeEndpoint",
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Resource": "arn:aws:sagemaker:us-west-2:<ACCOUNT_NUMBER>:endpoint/myEndpoint",
          "Principal": "*"
      }
  ]
}
```

**Connecting to SageMaker via the VPC Endpoint:**<br>
After you have created a VPC endpoint, you can use the following example CLI commands that use the endpoint-url parameter to specify interface endpoints to the SageMaker API or Runtime. This ensures that all connections to your SageMaker environment traverse the private network.
```
aws sagemaker list-notebook-instances --endpoint-url VPC_Endpoint_ID.api.sagemaker.Region.vpce.amazonaws.com

aws sagemaker list-training-jobs --endpoint-url VPC_Endpoint_ID.api.sagemaker.Region.vpce.amazonaws.com

aws sagemaker-runtime invoke-endpoint --endpoint-url VPC_Endpoint_ID.runtime.sagemaker.Region.vpce.amazonaws.com  \
    --endpoint-name Endpoint_Name \
    --body "Endpoint_Body" \
    --content-type "Content_Type" \
            Output_File
```
<br>

### 2. SageMaker notebook instances have Public Internet access disabled
Amazon SageMaker provides fully managed instances running Jupyter Notebooks for data exploration and preprocessing. But by default public Internet access is enabled for each instance, and this will cause the instance to fail CG's cloud security standards. This section will explain how to use SageMaker lifecycle configuration to ensure cloud control adherence.

**Capital Group Controls:** 
<br>
|Control Statement|Description|
|------|----------------------|
|[CS0012300](https://capitalgroup.service-now.com/cg_grc?sys_id=80df48c01bac20506a50beef034bcb47&table=sn_compliance_policy_statement&id=cg_grc_action_item_details&view=sp)|Cloud products and services must be deployed on private subnets and public access must be disabled for these services.|

**Why?**<br>
SageMaker as mentioned before is a service that is used in Machine Learning and may involve sensitive data, for this reason we want a lifecycle configuration that automatically disconnects notebook instances from the public internet so that you can apply controlled security settings in your notebook instances by default.
<br>

**How?**<br>
Currently if you connect a notebook instance to your virtual private cloud (VPC), the notebook instance could still provide an additional avenue for data access as the notebook lifecycle configuration has internet access turned on by default. The information below will detail how to run notebooks inside your private VPC, and turn off default internet accessibility.

 - **Create a Notebook in a VPC with no Internet Access**<br>
   - To get started with configuration of a notebook in a VPC, open the Amazon `SageMaker console` and create a new notebook instance. <br>
   - Select the `VPC` for your notebook instance connection. 
   - Youâ€™ll notice a few other fields are enabled. Select the `Subnet` and `Security group(s)` as part of the VPC setting.
   - To disable direct internet access, under Direct Internet access, simply choose `Disable â€“ use VPC only`
   - Select the `Create notebook instance` button at the bottom.<br>
   <img src="/docs/img/sagemaker/sagemaker_vpc.gif" width="600"><br>
   After a few minutes the New Notebook will be ready for use.<br><br>


### 3. SageMaker Studio IDE deployed in a Private VPC to prevent Public Access 
Amazon SageMaker Studio is the first fully integrated development environment (IDE) for machine learning (ML). With a single click, data scientists and developers can quickly spin up Amazon SageMaker Studio Notebooks for exploring datasets and building models. With the new ability to launch Amazon SageMaker Studio in your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), you can control the data flow from your Amazon SageMaker Studio notebooks. This allows you to restrict internet access, monitor and inspect traffic using standard AWS networking and security capabilities, and connect to other AWS resources through AWS PrivateLink or VPC endpoints.

**Why?**<br>
SageMaker Studio IDE is a service that data scientists and developers can quickly and easily build and train machine learning models, and then directly deploy them into a production-ready hosted environment. As the users may be working with sensitive data, We need to make sure that this traffic is not transmitted or accessible over the Public Internet and limited to only the CG VPC in which the infrastructure has been deployed.

**How?**<br>
The information below will detail how to deploy an AWS SageMaker Studio IDE Domain into a private VPC.

**Creating an Amazon SageMaker Studio domain inside a VPC**<br>
With existing infrastructure in place, you can create an Amazon SageMaker Studio domain and assign it to an existing CG VPC.

<img src="/docs/img/sagemaker/studio.jpg" width="800"/>

To create a domain, you can use the following:
 - The AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).
 - The AWS SDK.
 - The AWS Management Console.

We will use the **AWS Console** to create a Studio domain and tie it to an existing CG VPC, please follow these steps:

 - On the Amazon SageMaker console, choose SageMaker Studio.

> **NOTE:** If you donâ€™t have a domain created, a screen appears.
 - For Get Started, select Standard setup.
 - For Authentication method, select AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).
 - For Execution role for all users, choose your notebook IAM role (the default is `studiovpc-notebook-role`).
 - In the Network section, for VPC, choose your VPC (the default is `studiovpc-vpc`).
 - For Subnet, choose your subnet (the default is `studiovpc-private-subnet`).

Make sure to not choose studiovpc-endpoint-private-subnet.
 - For Network Access for Studio, select `VPC Only`, **this piece is very important**.
 - Choose Submit
