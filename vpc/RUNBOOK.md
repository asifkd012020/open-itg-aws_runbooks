## Overview
AWS provides a number of security features for Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) which help you comply with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. The following playbook will outline what the AWS best practices are, how they align to NIST, and how to implement these best practices within your organization.

These NIST Controls and Subcategories are not applicable to this service: ID, PR.AC-2, PR.AT, PR.DS (Unless stated), PR.IP (Unless Stated), PR.MA, PR.PT-2, DE.AE-4, DE.AE-5, DE.CM-2, DE.CM-6, DE.DP, RS.RP, RS.CO, RS.MI, RS.IM, RC

These Capital Group Control Statement is not applicable to this service: [9](#capital-group-control-statements)

## Preventative Controls
### 1. Implement Access Controls to Enforce Least Privilege
NIST CSF:
|NIST Subcategory Control|Description|
|-----------|------------------------|
|PR.AC-1|Identities and credentials are issued, managed, verified, revoked, and audited for authorized devices, users and processes|
|PR.AC-3|Remote access is managed|
|PR.AC-4|Access permissions and authorizations are managed, incorporating the principles of least privilege and separation of duties|
|PR.AC-6|Identities are proofed and bound to credentials and asserted in interactions|
|PR.AC-7|Users, devices, and other assets are authenticated (e.g., single-factor, multi-factor) commensurate with the risk of the transaction (e.g., individuals’ security and privacy risks and other organizational risks)|

Capital Group:
|Control Statement|Description|
|------|----------------------|
|5|AWS IAM User accounts are only to be created for use by services or products that do not support IAM Roles. Services are not allowed to create local accounts for human use within the service. All human user authentication will take place within CG’s Identity Provider.|
|8|AWS IAM User secrets, including passwords and secret access keys, are to be rotated every 90 days. Accounts created locally within any service must also have their secrets rotated every 90 days.|
|10|Administrative access to AWS resources will have MFA enabled|

**Why?** When you create custom policies, grant only the permissions required to perform a task. Start with a minimum set of permissions and grant additional permissions as necessary. Doing so is more secure than starting with permissions that are too lenient and then trying to tighten them later.  
To the extent that it's practical, define the conditions under which your identity-based policies allow access to a resource. For example, you can write conditions to specify a range of allowable IP addresses that a request must come from. You can also write conditions to allow requests only within a specified date or time range, or to require the use of SSL or MFA.

**How?** Amazon VPC shares its API namespace with Amazon EC2. Policy actions in Amazon VPC use the following prefix before the action: `ec2:`. For example, to grant someone permission to create a VPC with the Amazon EC2 `CreateVpc` API operation, you include the `ec2:CreateVpc` action in their policy.

Using the optional `Condition` element within an IAM policy allows you to grant or deny permissions to a user, group, or role, but only under certain circumstances. This allows you to enforce least privilege, where an administrator may need the ability to perform certain actions, but only under certain situations, or when performing the action within specified bounds.

*Example 1:*  
The following policy grants users permission to launch instances into any subnet within a specific VPC. The policy does this by applying a condition key (`ec2:Vpc`) to the subnet resource.

The policy also grants users permission to launch instances using only AMIs that have the tag `"department=dev"`.
```json
{
   "Version": "2012-10-17",
   "Statement": [{
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "ec2:RunInstances",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:region:account:subnet/*",
        "Condition": {
         "StringEquals": {
            "ec2:Vpc": "arn:aws:ec2:region:account:vpc/vpc-11223344556677889"
            }
      }
   },
   {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "ec2:RunInstances",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:region::image/ami-*",
      "Condition": {
         "StringEquals": {
            "ec2:ResourceTag/department": "dev"
            }
      }
   },
   {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "ec2:RunInstances",
      "Resource": [ 
         "arn:aws:ec2:region:account:instance/*",
         "arn:aws:ec2:region:account:volume/*",
         "arn:aws:ec2:region:account:network-interface/*",
         "arn:aws:ec2:region:account:key-pair/*",
         "arn:aws:ec2:region:account:security-group/*"
         ]
      }
   ]
}
```

*Example 2:*  
The following policy allows users to view and create security groups. It also allows them to add and remove inbound and outbound rules to any security group that's associated with `vpc-11223344556677889`.
```json
{
   "Version": "2012-10-17",
   "Statement": [{
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
         "ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups", "ec2:DescribeVpcs", "ec2:CreateSecurityGroup"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:DeleteSecurityGroup", "ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress", "ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupEgress",
        "ec2:RevokeSecurityGroupIngress", "ec2:RevokeSecurityGroupEgress"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:security-group/*",
      "Condition":{
         "ArnEquals": {
            "ec2:Vpc": "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:vpc/vpc-11223344556677889"
         }
      }
    }
   ]
}
```

For a reference to the available actions, resources, and conditions within the VPC service (and therefore, EC2 as well), see [Endnote 1](#endnote-1).

### 2. Enforce Data Protection Standards
NIST CSF:
|NIST Subcategory Control|Description|
|-----------|------------------------|
|PR.DS-1|Data-at-rest is protected|
|PR.DS-2|Data-in-transit is protected|

Capital Group:
|Control Statement|Description|
|------|----------------------|
|1|All Data-at-rest must be encrypted and use a CG BYOK encryption key.|
|2|All Data-in-transit must be encrypted using certificates using CG Certificate Authority.|
|3|Keys storied in a Key Management System (KMS) should be created by Capital Group's hardware security module (HSM) and are a minimum of AES-256.|
|4|AWS services should have logging enabled and those logs delivered to CloudTrail or Cloud Watch.|

**Why?** The VPC service itself does not store any data, so data-at-rest requirements do not directly impact this service. However, the storage of VPC Flow Logs needs to be encrypted. VPC Flow Logs contain information about traffic moving through a VPC. This information includes source and destination IPs, ports, and times, among other relevant info.

**How?** All communications with the VPC API are encrypted using industry-standard TLS. There is no action required within the VPC service to comply with the data-at-rest requirement.

VPC Flow Logs are stored in CloudWatch Logs prior to being ingested by Splunk. Setting up a customer master key (CMK) for encrypting the logs at rest is relatively straight-forward. This can be done either during the log group creation, or at any point after creation.  
The only caveat to setting up the key to work with the log group is to set up the key policy with appropriate permissions. The following is a clip from a policy that allows CloudWatch Logs to use the key as long as it is only with a specific log group:  
```json
...
{
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "logs.region.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": [
                "kms:Encrypt*",
                "kms:Decrypt*",
                "kms:ReEncrypt*",
                "kms:GenerateDataKey*",
                "kms:Describe*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*",
            "Condition": {
                "ArnEquals": {
                    "kms:EncryptionContext:aws:logs:arn": "arn:aws:logs:region:account-id:log-group:log-group-name"
                }
            }
        }
...
```

#### To associate the CMK with a log group when you create it <!-- omit in toc -->

Use the `create-log-group` command as follows:
```
aws logs create-log-group --log-group-name my-log-group --kms-key-id "key-arn"
```
#### To associate the CMK with an existing log group <!-- omit in toc -->

Use the `associate-kms-key` command as follows:
```
aws logs associate-kms-key --log-group-name my-log-group --kms-key-id "key-arn"
```

### 3. Change the Default Security Group for the VPC
NIST CSF:
|NIST Subcategory Control|Description|
|-----------|------------------------|
|PR.PT-4|Communications and control networks are protected|
|PR.AC-3|Remote access is managed|
|PR.AC-5|Network integrity is protected (e.g., network segregation, network segmentation)|

**Why?** Your VPC automatically comes with a default security group. If you don't specify a different security group when you launch the instance, AWS will associate the default security group with your instance.

*Note*
*If you launch an instance in the Amazon EC2 console, the launch instance wizard automatically defines a `"launch-wizard-xx"` security group, which you can associate with the instance instead of the default security group.*

The following table describes the default rules for a default security group.
#### Inbound <!-- omit in toc -->
|Source|Protocol|Port range|Description|
|------|--------|----------|-----------|
|The security group ID (sg-xxxxxxxx)|All|All|Allow inbound traffic from network interfaces (and their associated instances) that are assigned to the same security group.|

#### Outbound <!-- omit in toc -->
|Destination|Protocol|Port range|Description|
|-----------|--------|----------|-----------|
|0.0.0.0/0|All|All|Allow all outbound IPv4 traffic.|
|::/0|All|All|Allow all outbound IPv6 traffic. This rule is added by default if you create a VPC with an IPv6 CIDR block or if you associate an IPv6 CIDR block with your existing VPC.|

**How?** You can't delete this group; however, you can change the group's rules. The procedure is the same as modifying any other security group. Based on the use case for each specific VPC, the default Security Group should allow the minimum traffic required for basic functionality.

When you add or remove a rule, any instances already assigned to the security group are subject to the change.

If you have a VPC peering connection, you can reference security groups from the peer VPC as the source or destination in your security group rules. For more information, see [Endnote 2](#endnote-2).

#### To add a rule using the console <!-- omit in toc -->

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at <https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/>.
2. In the navigation pane, choose **Security Groups**.
3. Select the security group to update.
4. Choose **Actions, Edit inbound rules** or **Actions, Edit outbound rules**.
5. Choose **Add rule**. For **Type**, select the traffic type, and then specify the source (inbound rules) or destination (outbound rules).  
   The use of address range `0.0.0.0/0` is prohibited in production environments, and is only allowed temporarily in development. This will enable all IPv4 addresses to access your instance. To restrict access, enter a specific IP address or range of addresses.
6. Choose **Save rules**.

#### To delete a rule using the console <!-- omit in toc -->

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at <https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/>.
2. In the navigation pane, choose **Security Groups**.
3. Select the security group to update.
4. Choose **Actions, Edit inbound rules** or **Actions, Edit outbound rules**.
5. Choose the delete button (“x”) to the right of the rule that you want to delete.
6. Choose **Save rules**.

When you modify the protocol, port range, or source or destination of an existing security group rule using the console, the console deletes the existing rule and adds a new one for you.

#### To update a rule using the console <!-- omit in toc -->

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at <https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/>.
2. In the navigation pane, choose **Security Groups**.
3. Select the security group to update.
4. Choose **Actions, Edit inbound rules** or **Actions, Edit outbound rules**.
5. Modify the rule entry as required.
6. Choose **Save rules**.

If you are updating the protocol, port range, or source or destination of an existing rule using the Amazon EC2 API or a command line tool, you cannot modify the rule. Instead, you must delete the existing rule and add a new rule. To update the rule description only, you can use the `update-security-group-rule-descriptions-ingress` and `update-security-group-rule-descriptions-egress` commands.

#### To add a rule to a security group using the command line <!-- omit in toc -->

[`authorize-security-group-ingress`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/authorize-security-group-ingress.html) and [`authorize-security-group-egress`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/authorize-security-group-egress.html) (Select a command to see its CLI Reference)

#### To delete a rule from a security group using the command line <!-- omit in toc -->

[`revoke-security-group-ingress`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/revoke-security-group-ingress.html) and [`revoke-security-group-egress`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/revoke-security-group-egress.html) (Select a command to see its CLI Reference)

#### To update the description for a security group rule using the command line <!-- omit in toc -->

[`update-security-group-rule-descriptions-ingress`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/update-security-group-rule-descriptions-ingress.html) and [`update-security-group-rule-descriptions-egress`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/update-security-group-rule-descriptions-egress.html) (Select a command to see its CLI Reference)

### 4. Control Access to VPC Endpoints
NIST CSF:
|NIST Subcategory Control|Description|
|-----------|------------------------|
|PR.PT-4|Communications and control networks are protected|
|PR.AC-3|Remote access is managed|
|PR.AC-5|Network integrity is protected (e.g., network segregation, network segmentation)|

Capital Group:
|Control Statement|Description|
|------|----------------------|
|6|Any AWS service used by CG should not be directly available to the Internet and the default route is always the CG gateway.|
|7|Use of AWS IAM accounts are restricted to CG networks.|

**Why** As part of Capital Group's internal controls, all services must be accessed using the AWS network (or, backbone), meaning traffic cannot traverse the public Internet before reaching a service. This is accomplished in AWS using VPC Endpoints. These endpoints route all traffic from a VPC to a service using private IP addresses and DNS. As these are a required part of CG's cloud infrastructure, it is important that they are locked down to only those users who need to access them. This is done using IAM Policies.

**How** By default, IAM users do not have permission to work with endpoints. You can create an IAM user policy that grants users the permissions to create, modify, describe, and delete endpoints. The following is an example, which allows the attached principal to perform any actions pertaining to VPC Endpoints.
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement":[{
    "Effect":"Allow",
    "Action":"ec2:*VpcEndpoint*",
    "Resource":"*"
    }
  ]
}
```

It is possible to further restrict the actions available to the principal, and when they are available. This is similar to control number 1, mentioned earlier. As an example, you can use the `ec2:VpceServiceName` condition key to control what VPC endpoint can be created based on the VPC endpoint service name. In the following example, you can only create or VPC endpoint when the service name is `com.amazonaws.us-east-1.s3`. To use this example, substitute the account ID, the service name, and the Region (unless you are using the us-east-1 Region).
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "ec2:CreateVpcEndpoint",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:accountId:vpc-endpoint/*"
            ],
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "ec2:VpceServiceName": [
                        "com.amazonaws.us-east-1.s3"
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

## Detective
### 1. Utilize VPC Flow logs with Amazon CloudWatch
NIST CSF:
|NIST Subcategory Control|Description|
|-----------|------------------------|
|DE.AE-2|Detected events are analyzed to understand attack targets and methods|
|DE.AE-3|Event data are aggregated and correlated from multiple sources and sensors|
|DE.AE-4|Impact of an event is determined|
|DE.CM-1|The network is monitored to detect potential cybersecurity events|

Capital Group:
|Control Statement|Description|
|------|----------------------|
|4|AWS services should have logging enabled and those logs delivered to CloudTrail or Cloud Watch|


**Why?** 
Flow logs capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC. You can create a flow log for a VPC, subnet, or individual network interface. Flow log data is published to CloudWatch Logs or Amazon S3, and can help you diagnose overly restrictive or overly permissive security group and network ACL rules.

**How?** 
#### Publish flow logs to CloudWatch Logs <!-- omit in toc -->

Flow logs can publish flow log data directly to Amazon CloudWatch\.

When publishing to CloudWatch Logs, flow log data is published to a log group, and each network interface has a unique log stream in the log group\. Log streams contain flow log records\. You can create multiple flow logs that publish data to the same log group\. If the same network interface is present in one or more flow logs in the same log group, it has one combined log stream\. If you've specified that one flow log should capture rejected traffic, and the other flow log should capture accepted traffic, then the combined log stream captures all traffic\.

In CloudWatch Logs, the **timestamp** field corresponds to the start time that's captured in the flow log record\. The **ingestionTime** field indicates the date and time when the flow log record was received by CloudWatch Logs\. This timestamp is later than the end time that's captured in the flow log record\.

#### IAM roles for publishing flow logs to CloudWatch Logs <!-- omit in toc -->

The IAM role that's associated with your flow log must have sufficient permissions to publish flow logs to the specified log group in CloudWatch Logs\. The IAM role must belong to your AWS account\.

The IAM policy that's attached to your IAM role must include at least the following permissions\.

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": [
        "logs:CreateLogGroup",
        "logs:CreateLogStream",
        "logs:PutLogEvents",
        "logs:DescribeLogGroups",
        "logs:DescribeLogStreams"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

Also ensure that your role has a trust relationship that allows the flow logs service to assume the role\.

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "vpc-flow-logs.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
```

Users must also have permissions to use the iam:PassRole action for the IAM role that's associated with the flow log\.

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["iam:PassRole"],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::account-id:role/flow-log-role-name"
    }
  ]
}
```

You can update an existing role or use the following procedure to create a new role for use with flow logs\.

#### Creating a flow logs role <!-- omit in toc -->

1. For **Format**, specify the format for the flow log record\.
   + To use the default flow log record format, choose **AWS default format**\.
   + To create a custom format, choose **Custom format**\. For **Log format**, choose the fields to include in the flow log record\.
**Tip**  
To create a custom flow log that includes the default format fields, first choose **AWS default format**, copy the fields in **Format preview**, then choose **Custom format** and paste the fields in the text box\.

1. \(Optional\) Choose **Add Tag** to apply tags to the flow log\.

1. Choose **Create**\.

**To create a flow log that publishes to CloudWatch Logs using a command line tool**  
Use one of the following commands\.
+ [create\-flow\-logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-flow-logs.html) \(AWS CLI\)
+ [New\-EC2FlowLogs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/New-EC2FlowLogs.html) \(AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell\)
+ [CreateFlowLogs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_CreateFlowLogs.html) \(Amazon EC2 Query API\)

The following AWS CLI example creates a flow log that captures all accepted traffic for subnet `subnet-1a2b3c4d`\. The flow logs are delivered to a log group in CloudWatch Logs called `my-flow-logs`, in account 123456789101, using the IAM role `publishFlowLogs`\.

```
aws ec2 create-flow-logs --resource-type Subnet --resource-ids subnet-1a2b3c4d --traffic-type ACCEPT --log-group-name my-flow-logs --deliver-logs-permission-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789101:role/publishFlowLogs
```

#### Processing flow log records in CloudWatch Logs <!-- omit in toc -->

You can work with flow log records as you would with any other log events collected by CloudWatch Logs\. For more information about monitoring log data and metric filters, see [Searching and Filtering Log Data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/MonitoringLogData.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.

#### Example: Creating a CloudWatch metric filter and alarm for a flow log <!-- omit in toc -->

In this example, you have a flow log for `eni-1a2b3c4d`\. You want to create an alarm that alerts you if there have been 10 or more rejected attempts to connect to your instance over TCP port 22 \(SSH\) within a 1\-hour time period\. First, you must create a metric filter that matches the pattern of the traffic for which to create the alarm\. Then, you can create an alarm for the metric filter\.

**To create a metric filter for rejected SSH traffic and create an alarm for the filter**

1. Open the CloudWatch console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Logs**\.

1. Choose the associated **Metric Filters** value for the log group for your flow log, and then choose **Add Metric Filter**\.

1. For **Filter Pattern**, enter the following\.

   ```
   [version, account, eni, source, destination, srcport, destport="22", protocol="6", packets, bytes, windowstart, windowend, action="REJECT", flowlogstatus]
   ```

1. For **Select Log Data to Test**, select the log stream for your network interface\. \(Optional\) To view the lines of log data that match the filter pattern, choose **Test Pattern**\. When you're ready, choose **Assign Metric**\.

1. Provide a metric namespace and name, and ensure that the metric value is set to **1**\. When you're done, choose **Create Filter**\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Alarms**, **Create Alarm**\.

1. In the **Custom Metrics** section, choose the namespace for the metric filter that you created\.

   It can take a few minutes for a new metric to display in the console\.

1. Select the metric name that you created, and choose **Next**\.

1. Enter a name and description for the alarm\. For the **is** fields, choose **>=** and enter **10**\. For the **for** field, leave the default **1** for the consecutive periods\.

1. For **Period**, choose **1 Hour**\. For **Statistic**, choose **Sum**\. The `Sum` statistic ensures that you are capturing the total number of data points for the specified time period\. 

1. In the **Actions** section, you can choose to send a notification to an existing list\. Or, you can create a new list and enter the email addresses that should receive a notification when the alarm is triggered\. When you are done, choose **Create Alarm**\.

**Why?** 
You can create a notification to receive alerts for specific events that occur on the endpoints that are attached to your endpoint service\.
**How?** 
#### Create and manage a notifications for an endpoint service <!-- omit in toc -->

You can receive an email when an endpoint request is accepted or rejected for your endpoint service\. To create a notification, you must associate an Amazon SNS topic with the notification\. You can subscribe to the SNS topic to receive an email notification when an endpoint event occurs\. For more information, see the [Amazon Simple Notification Service Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/)\.

The Amazon SNS topic that you use for notifications must have a topic policy that allows the Amazon VPC endpoint service to publish notifications on your behalf\. Ensure that you include the following statement in your topic policy\. For more information, see [Managing Access to Your Amazon SNS Topics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/AccessPolicyLanguage.html) in the *Amazon Simple Notification Service Developer Guide*\.
