## Overview
Amazon EventBridge is a serverless event bus that makes it easier to build event-driven applications at scale using events generated from your applications, integrated Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications, and AWS services. EventBridge delivers a stream of real-time data from event sources such as Zendesk or Shopify to targets like AWS Lambda and other SaaS applications. You can set up routing rules to determine where to send your data to build application architectures that react in real-time to your data sources with event publisher and consumer completely decoupled.

### Key Benefits
 - Build event-driven architectures
 - Write less custom code
 - Reduce operational overhead
 - Connect SaaS apps

### How it works
EventBridge connects applications using events. An event is a signal that a system’s state has changed, such as a change in the status of a customer support ticket. Customers can integrate their own AWS applications with microservices, SaaS applications and custom applications as event sources which publish events to an event bus. You can define a filtering rule to filter events and route events to AWS service targets and API destinations (via HTTP endpoint). EventBridge schema registry stores schema generated by your organization’s applications, AWS services, or SaaS applications which includes information such as the title, format and validation rules for event data. You can download code bindings for any schema in the registry in your IDE and directly use the strongly-typed object representing the event in your code.

### 1. EventBridge Utilizes VPC Endpoints to Prevent Public Access
Following CG's stringent cloud security controls, you should establish a private connection between your VPC and EventBridge. You can use this connection to enable EventBridge to communicate with your resources on your VPC without going through the public internet.

**Why?**<br>
CG has stringent cloud security controls around how services need to be secured, so that they are not publicly accessible. One of the ways to ensure that a service is only accessible to CG networks is to deploy the service using VPC Interface Endpoints.

## Capital Group Glossory 
**Data** - Digital pieces of information stored or transmitted for use with an information system from which understandable information is derived. Items that could be considered to be data are: Source code, meta-data, build artifacts, information input and output.  
 
**Information System** - An organized assembly of resources and procedures for the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information. All systems, platforms, compute instances including and not limited to physical and virtual client endpoints, physical and virtual servers, software containers, databases, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, network devices, applications (internal and external), Serverless computing instances (i.e. AWS Lambda), vendor provided appliances, and third-party platforms, connected to the Capital Group network or used by Capital Group users or customers.

**Log** - a record of the events occurring within information systems and networks. Logs are composed of log entries; each entry contains information related to a specific event that has occurred within a system or network.

**Information** - communication or representation of knowledge such as facts, data, or opinions in any medium or form, including textual, numerical, graphic, cartographic, narrative, or audiovisual. 

**Cloud computing** - A model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

**Vulnerability**  - Weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat source. Note: The term weakness is synonymous for deficiency. Weakness may result in security and/or privacy risks.
