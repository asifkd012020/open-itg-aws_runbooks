## Overview
Amazon EventBridge is a serverless event bus that makes it easier to build event-driven applications at scale using events generated from your applications, integrated Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications, and AWS services. EventBridge delivers a stream of real-time data from event sources such as Zendesk or Shopify to targets like AWS Lambda and other SaaS applications. You can set up routing rules to determine where to send your data to build application architectures that react in real-time to your data sources with event publisher and consumer completely decoupled.

### Key Benefits
 - Build event-driven architectures
 - Write less custom code
 - Reduce operational overhead
 - Connect SaaS apps

### How it works
EventBridge connects applications using events. An event is a signal that a system’s state has changed, such as a change in the status of a customer support ticket. Customers can integrate their own AWS applications with microservices, SaaS applications and custom applications as event sources which publish events to an event bus. You can define a filtering rule to filter events and route events to AWS service targets and API destinations (via HTTP endpoint). EventBridge schema registry stores schema generated by your organization’s applications, AWS services, or SaaS applications which includes information such as the title, format and validation rules for event data. You can download code bindings for any schema in the registry in your IDE and directly use the strongly-typed object representing the event in your code.

### 1. EventBridge Utilizes VPC Endpoints to Prevent Public Access
Following CG's stringent cloud security controls, you should establish a private connection between your VPC and EventBridge. You can use this connection to enable EventBridge to communicate with your resources on your VPC without going through the public internet.

**Why?**<br>
CG has stringent cloud security controls around how services need to be secured, so that they are not publicly accessible. One of the ways to ensure that a service is only accessible to CG networks is to deploy the service using VPC Interface Endpoints.

**How?**<br>
When establishing a private connection between your virtual private cloud (VPC) and the Amazon EventBridge service, you should create an interface VPC endpoint. You can use this connection to call the Amazon EventBridge service from your VPC without sending traffic over the Internet. The endpoint provides secure connectivity to the Amazon EventBridge service without requiring an Internet gateway (IGW), NAT instance, or virtual private network (VPN) connection.

Interface VPC endpoints are powered by AWS PrivateLink, a feature that enables private communication between AWS services using private IP addresses. To use AWS PrivateLink, create an interface VPC endpoint for Amazon EventBridge in your VPC using the Amazon VPC console, API, or CLI. Doing this creates an elastic network interface in your subnet with a private IP address that serves Amazon EventBridge requests. You can also access a VPC endpoint from on-premises environments or from other VPCs using AWS VPN, AWS Direct Connect, or VPC peering. 


### Below are the steps to implement Interface VPC Endpoints for EventBridge:

**Creation of Interface VPC Endpoint:**
  1. Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/, and choose Endpoints from the navigation pane at left.
  2. Choose Create Endpoint.
     - For Service category, choose AWS service. 
     - For Service Name, choose Config in your AWS Region (for example, `com.amazonaws.us-east-1.events`).
     - Then choose the VPC, if it does not already exist follow this [link](https://github.com/open-itg/aws_runbooks/blob/master/vpc/RUNBOOK.md) for instructions on how to create a new VPC. 
     - Select a security group for AWS Config, if the default security group will not suffice then follow this [link](https://github.com/open-itg/aws_runbooks/blob/master/vpc/RUNBOOK.md) for instructions on how to create a new Security Group. 
     - Make sure that you `Enable` the Enable Private DNS Name check box.
     - Now add the appropriate `CG standard tags`.
  4. Click `Create Endpoint` to complete the process.
  5. The EventBridge service will now be accessible via the private endpoint for all requests within the VPC.
