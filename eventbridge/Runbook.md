## Overview
Amazon EventBridge is a serverless event bus that makes it easier to build event-driven applications at scale using events generated from your applications, integrated Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications, and AWS services. EventBridge delivers a stream of real-time data from event sources such as Zendesk or Shopify to targets like AWS Lambda and other SaaS applications. You can set up routing rules to determine where to send your data to build application architectures that react in real-time to your data sources with event publisher and consumer completely decoupled.

### Key Benefits
 - Build event-driven architectures
 - Write less custom code
 - Reduce operational overhead
 - Connect SaaS apps

### How it works
EventBridge connects applications using events. An event is a signal that a system’s state has changed, such as a change in the status of a customer support ticket. Customers can integrate their own AWS applications with microservices, SaaS applications and custom applications as event sources which publish events to an event bus. You can define a filtering rule to filter events and route events to AWS service targets and API destinations (via HTTP endpoint). EventBridge schema registry stores schema generated by your organization’s applications, AWS services, or SaaS applications which includes information such as the title, format and validation rules for event data. You can download code bindings for any schema in the registry in your IDE and directly use the strongly-typed object representing the event in your code.
