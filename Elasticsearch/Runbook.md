## Overview
Amazon Elasticsearch Service is a fully managed service that makes it easy for you to deploy, secure, and run Elasticsearch cost effectively at scale. You can build, monitor, and troubleshoot your applications using the tools you love, at the scale you need. The service provides support for open source Elasticsearch APIs, managed Kibana, integration with Logstash and other AWS services, and built-in alerting and SQL querying. 

Amazon Elasticsearch Service lets you pay only for what you use â€“ there are no upfront costs or usage requirements. With Amazon Elasticsearch Service, you get the ELK stack you need, without the operational overhead.

### Benefits & Features
1. Easy to deploy and manage
2. Highly scalable and available
3. Highly secure
4. Cost-effective

## Preventative Controls

### 1. ElasticSearch deployed within VPC to Prevent Public Access
Following CG's stringent cloud security controls, you should ElasticSearch within a private VPC.
<br>

**Capital Group Controls:** 
<br>

|Control Statement|Description|
|------|----------------------|
|[CS0012318](https://capitalgroup.service-now.com/cg_grc?sys_id=534f8d4b1bea6850371277741a4bcbc2&table=sn_compliance_policy_statement&id=cg_grc_action_item_details&view=sp)|Direct external connectivity to and from internal CG systems is not permitted. Connectivity to external networks must traverse traffic control devices in the perimeter network zones. |
<br>

**Why?**<br>
CG has stringent cloud security controls around how services need to be secured, so that they are not publicly accessible. One of the ways to ensure that a service is only accessible to CG networks is to deploy the service within a private VPC.

Placing an Amazon ES domain within a VPC enables secure communication between Amazon ES and other services within the VPC without the need for an internet gateway, NAT device, or VPN connection. All traffic remains securely within the AWS Cloud. Because of their logical isolation, domains that reside within a VPC have an extra layer of security when compared to domains that use public endpoints.

**How?**<br>
### Steps to Deploy ES Domain withing a VPC
When deploying a new ElasticSearch Domain within your AWS Account, as mentioned previously, there are steps that can be taken to ensure deployment within a specific VPC. This can be acomplished during the `third step` of the **`Create New Domain`** wizzard explained below:

<img src="/docs/img/elasticsearch/vpc.png" width="1000"><br>

1. Make sure to select the `VPC Access (Recommended)` radio button, so that the `Public access` radio button is unselected. As seen in the screenshot above.
2. Select the VPC that will host the new ES Domain, this may be the `Default VPC`, but in this case no IGW or NatGW should exist.
3. Next Select the Subnet / Subnets that will be used for IP address assignment for the ES resources. Please make sure that there are adequite IP addresses available in the subnets.
4. Next Select the `Security Group` that will control access to and from the ES Domain resources. By default the security group should only allow access to and from Elastic Search based on ports needed for the service to function correctly.
5. This concludes the settings for VPC enablement.

## Capital Group Glossory 
**Data** - Digital pieces of information stored or transmitted for use with an information system from which understandable information is derived. Items that could be considered to be data are: Source code, meta-data, build artifacts, information input and output.  
 
**Information System** - An organized assembly of resources and procedures for the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information. All systems, platforms, compute instances including and not limited to physical and virtual client endpoints, physical and virtual servers, software containers, databases, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, network devices, applications (internal and external), Serverless computing instances (i.e. AWS Lambda), vendor provided appliances, and third-party platforms, connected to the Capital Group network or used by Capital Group users or customers.

**Log** - a record of the events occurring within information systems and networks. Logs are composed of log entries; each entry contains information related to a specific event that has occurred within a system or network.

**Information** - communication or representation of knowledge such as facts, data, or opinions in any medium or form, including textual, numerical, graphic, cartographic, narrative, or audiovisual. 

**Cloud computing** - A model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

**Vulnerability**  - Weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat source. Note: The term weakness is synonymous for deficiency. Weakness may result in security and/or privacy risks.
