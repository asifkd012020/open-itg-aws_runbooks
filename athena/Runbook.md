## Overview
Data analysis has always been a complex process that many tools have aimed to simplify and speed up over the years. Amazon has aimed to solve the bottlenecks in data analysis with its new service named Athena. Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data in Amazon S3 using standard SQL. Athena is serverless, so there is no infrastructure to manage, and you pay only for the queries that you run.  

**Athena Core Features:**<br>
- **Easy of Deployment:** Athena doesn’t require installation. It can be accessed directly from the AWS Console also directly by AWS CLI.

- **Serverless:** It is serverless, so the end-user doesn’t need to worry about infrastructure, configuration, scaling or failure. Athena takes care of everything on its own.

- **Pay per query:** Athena charges you only for the query you run, i.e. the amount of data that is managed per query. You can save a lot if you can compress them and format your dataset accordingly.

- **Speed:** Athena is a very fast analytics tool. It can perform complex queries in less time by breaking the complex queries into simpler ones and run them parallelly, then combine the results to give the desired output.

- **Secure:** Using VPC Endpoints and With the help of IAM policies and AWS Identity, Athena gives you complete control over your data sets. As the data is stored in S3 buckets, IAM policies can help you manage control to users.

- **Highly available:** With the assurance of AWS, Athena is highly available and the user can execute queries round the clock. As AWS is 99.999% available, so is Athena.

- **Integration:** The best feature of Athena is that it can be integrated with AWS Glue. AWS Glue will help the user to create a better-unified data repository. This helps you create better versioning of data, better tables, views, etc. <br>

## Preventative Controls
<img src="/docs/img/Prevent.png" width="50"><br>

### 1. Athena Deployed using VPC Endpoints
 - Create VPC Endpoints for Athena
 - Create and attach appropriate Security Groups

### 2. IAM roles for access to Athena defined following least privilege model
 - Athena assumes the application user role
 - Query results will be stored to restrict unauthorized access

### 3. Enforce Enryption at Rest for Athena
 - Enable encryption for query results

 `This Section will be updated soon.`

### 4. Enforce Enryption in Transit for Athena
 - Encrypt data in transit using TLS 1.2

 `This Section will be updated soon.`

## Detective Controls

### 1. Athena resources are tagged according to CG standards
`This Section will be updated soon.`

### 2. CloudTrail logging enabled and sent to Splunk

## Capital Group Glossory 
**Data** - Digital pieces of information stored or transmitted for use with an information system from which understandable information is derived. Items that could be considered to be data are: Source code, meta-data, build artifacts, information input and output.  
 
**Information System** - An organized assembly of resources and procedures for the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information. All systems, platforms, compute instances including and not limited to physical and virtual client endpoints, physical and virtual servers, software containers, databases, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, network devices, applications (internal and external), Serverless computing instances (i.e. AWS Lambda), vendor provided appliances, and third-party platforms, connected to the Capital Group network or used by Capital Group users or customers.

**Log** - a record of the events occurring within information systems and networks. Logs are composed of log entries; each entry contains information related to a specific event that has occurred within a system or network.

**Information** - communication or representation of knowledge such as facts, data, or opinions in any medium or form, including textual, numerical, graphic, cartographic, narrative, or audiovisual. 

**Cloud computing** - A model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

**Vulnerability**  - Weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat source. Note: The term weakness is synonymous for deficiency. Weakness may result in security and/or privacy risks.
