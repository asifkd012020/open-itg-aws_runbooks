## Overview
AWS Cloud9 is an integrated development environment, or IDE. The AWS Cloud9 IDE offers a rich code-editing experience with support for several programming languages and runtime debuggers, and a built-in terminal. It contains a collection of tools that you use to code, build, run, test, and debug software, and helps you release software to the cloud.

You access the AWS Cloud9 IDE through a web browser. You can also configure the IDE to your preferences. You can switch color themes, bind shortcut keys, enable programming language-specific syntax coloring and code formatting, and more. Below is a diagram showing a standard secure deployment of Cloud9.

<img src="/docs/img/cloud9/c9_example.jpg" width="800"><br>

**The core features of Cloud9 allow developers to:**
 - Work with code in several programming languages and the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK).
 - Work with code in a running Docker container.
 - Use online code repositories.
 - Collaborate with others in real time.
 - Interact with various database and website technologies.
 - Targeting AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, and AWS Serverless Applications.
 - Taking advantage of other AWS products such as Amazon Lightsail, AWS CodeStar, and AWS CodePipeline.

## Preventative Controls

### 1. Cloud9 deployed in Private VPC with no-ingress EC2 instances
Cloud9 as a service runs on top of EC2 instances as its backend, and this allows us to enforce public access controls as per the current CG cloud standards. This section details the process of deploying Cloud9 on no-ingress EC2 instances in a private VPC on a CG internal subnet. 

**NIST CSF:** <br>

|NIST Subcategory Control|Description|
|-----------|------------------------|
|PR.PT-4|Communications and control networks are protected|
|PR.PT-5|Mechanisms (e.g., failsafe, load balancing, hot swap) are implemented to achieve resilience requirements in normal and adverse situations|
|PR.AC-3|Remote access is managed|
|PR.AC-5|Network integrity is protected (e.g., network segregation, network segmentation)|
<br>

**Capital Group:** <br>

|Control Statement|Description|
|------|----------------------|
|6|Any AWS service used by CG should not be directly available to the Internet and the default route is always the CG gateway.|
|7|Use of AWS IAM accounts are restricted to CG networks.|
<br>

**Why?**<br>
Prior to supporting deployment within a Private VPC, Cloud9 environments had to have a public IP address and the SSH port configured to be accessible from AWS Cloud9. Today AWS reinforced Cloud9's security posture by no longer requiring inbound connections to Cloud9 environments. This feature leverages AWS Systems Manager (SSM) to eliminate the need for SSH connections, and allows SSM to be the only ingress point into the underlying Cloud9 EC2 instances. This fits in line with CG's standards related to no public access by default.
<br>

**How?**<br>
Creation of Cloud9 resources that adhere to CG's current Security Standards and Controls will begin below with the creation of no-ingress EC2 instances. As mentioned previously this is a relativly new feature and helps CG enable public access restrictions on the service. 

As part of this process, AWS Cloud9 automatically creates three IAM resources pre-configured with the appropriate permissions:
 - *An IAM service-linked role (AWSServiceRoleForAWSCloud9)*
 - *A service role (AWSCloud9SSMAccessRole)*
 - *An instance profile (AWSCloud9SSMInstanceProfile)*<br>

**Creation of a Non-Ingress EC2 Environment**<br>
In this section Cloud9 will create an EC2 instance, and then connects the environment to this newly created instance. AWS Cloud9 manages the lifecycle of this instance, including starting, stopping, and restarting the instance as needed. If you ever delete this environment, AWS Cloud9 automatically terminates this instance.<br><br>
   **Step 1:** Sign into your AWS account and navigate to the *"Cloud9"* service via the AWS search bar as below.<br>
   <img src="/docs/img/cloud9/search.png" width="600">

   **Step 2:** Click *"Create Environment"*, and enter a Name and Description as below.<br>
   <img src="/docs/img/cloud9/step2.png" width="600">

   **Step 3:** Select the *"Create a new no-ingress EC2 Instance..."* option, as this is the option needed to secure Cloud9 to CG's standards.<br>
   <img src="/docs/img/cloud9/step3.png" width="600">

   **Step 4:** Select the appropriate EC2 *"Instance Type"* and *"Platform"*.

   **Step 5:** Select the appropriate VPC that was deployed as per the [VPC Runbook](https://github.com/open-itg/aws_runbooks/blob/master/vpc/RUNBOOK.md), for private internal networks. Thereafter select the appropriate *"Subnet"* that we will deploy into, this should have been deployed with the VPC.<br>
   <img src="/docs/img/cloud9/step5.png" width="600"><br>

   **Step 6:** Review the configuration and ceploy the Cloud9 Instance.<br><br>

   **NOTE 1:** *Deploying Cloud9 on a Subnet within a Private VPC does not currently support AWS Temporary managed credentials. This will be discussed further in a later section of this runbook.*<br><br>
   **NOTE 2:** *If Cloud9 is required for work on items such as Lambda or access to outside resources, two entries need to be added to the `~\.bashrc` file. This will allow Cloud9 to access external resources through our CG Proxy servers, and will allow adherence to the CG Standards for outbound access. The code snippit below shows the updated bashrc config.*
   ```
   export http_proxy=sjx1-cprx-vip.glb.capgroup.com
   export https_proxy=sjx1-cprx-vip.glb.capgroup.com

   or

   export http_proxy=asx1-cprx-vip.glb.capgroup.com
   export https_proxy=asx1-cprx-vip.glb.capgroup.com
   ```

### 2. Cloud9 deployed with Private Endpoint for SSM Integration
To complete the total network isolation of the Cloud9 product, a private Endpoint should be created for the SSM integration, this prevents the need for egress rules and allows the traffic to flow over Private Link.

**NIST CSF:** <br>

|NIST Subcategory Control|Description|
|-----------|------------------------|
|PR.PT-4|Communications and control networks are protected|
|PR.PT-5|Mechanisms (e.g., failsafe, load balancing, hot swap) are implemented to achieve resilience requirements in normal and adverse situations|
|PR.AC-3|Remote access is managed|
|PR.AC-5|Network integrity is protected (e.g., network segregation, network segmentation)|
<br>

**Capital Group:** <br>

|Control Statement|Description|
|------|----------------------|
|6|Any AWS service used by CG should not be directly available to the Internet and the default route is always the CG gateway.|
|7|Use of AWS IAM accounts are restricted to CG networks.|
<br>

**Why?**<br>
As mentioned previously, Public Access should be denied by default in accordance with CG's cloud security standards. With this in mind, Private VPC Endpoints enable Cloud9 to not rely on public network infrastructure and thus helps Cloud9 meet our strict standards.

**How?**<br>
To set up interface VPC endpoints for Session Manager
 - Create a [VPC security group](https://github.com/open-itg/aws_runbooks/blob/master/vpc/RUNBOOK.md) to allow ingress access over `HTTPS (port 443)` from the subnet where you will deploy your AWS Cloud9 environment. This is applied to your interface VPC endpoints to allow connections from your AWS Cloud9 instance to use Systems Manager.
 - Create a VPC endpoint by navigating to the VPC service, Select Endpoint Services and click Create Endpoint Service, as below.<br>
 <img src="/docs/img/cloud9/create_endpoint.png" width="600"><br>
 - In the list of Service Names, select `com.amazonaws.<"region">.ssm` service as shown below.<br>
 <img src="/docs/img/cloud9/vpce.jpg" width="600"><br>
 - Next, select your **VPC** and **Private Subnets** you want to associate the interface VPC endpoint with.
 - Choose **Enable** for this endpoint for the Enable DNS name setting.
 - Select the **Security Group** you created at the beginning.
 - Add the **CG Standard tags** for the interface VPC endpoint.
 - Choose **Create** endpoint.
 - **Repeat** the Steps to create interface VPC endpoints for the `com.amazonaws.<"region">.ssmmessages` and `com.amazonaws.<"region">.ec2messages` services.

**NOTE:** *When all three interface VPC endpoints have a status of available, the SSM service should now be available over Privatelink for Cloud9.*<br><br>

                    ]
