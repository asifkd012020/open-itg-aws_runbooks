## Overview
AWS Cloud9 is an integrated development environment, or IDE. The AWS Cloud9 IDE offers a rich code-editing experience with support for several programming languages and runtime debuggers, and a built-in terminal. It contains a collection of tools that you use to code, build, run, test, and debug software, and helps you release software to the cloud.

You access the AWS Cloud9 IDE through a web browser. You can also configure the IDE to your preferences. You can switch color themes, bind shortcut keys, enable programming language-specific syntax coloring and code formatting, and more. Below is a diagram showing a standard secure deployment of Cloud9.

**The core features of Cloud9 allow developers to:**
 - Work with code in several programming languages and the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK).
 - Work with code in a running Docker container.
 - Use online code repositories.
 - Collaborate with others in real time.
 - Interact with various database and website technologies.
 - Targeting AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, and AWS Serverless Applications.
 - Taking advantage of other AWS products such as Amazon Lightsail, AWS CodeStar, and AWS CodePipeline.

### 1. Cloud9 deployed in Private VPC with no-ingress EC2 instances
Cloud9 as a service runs on top of EC2 instances as its backend, and this allows us to enforce public access controls as per the current CG cloud standards. This section details the process of deploying Cloud9 on no-ingress EC2 instances in a private VPC on a CG internal subnet. 

**NIST CSF:** <br>

|NIST Subcategory Control|Description|
|-----------|------------------------|
|PR.PT-4|Communications and control networks are protected|
|PR.PT-5|Mechanisms (e.g., failsafe, load balancing, hot swap) are implemented to achieve resilience requirements in normal and adverse situations|
|PR.AC-3|Remote access is managed|
|PR.AC-5|Network integrity is protected (e.g., network segregation, network segmentation)|
<br>

**Capital Group:** <br>

|Control Statement|Description|
|------|----------------------|
|6|Any AWS service used by CG should not be directly available to the Internet and the default route is always the CG gateway.|
|7|Use of AWS IAM accounts are restricted to CG networks.|
<br>

**Why?**<br>
Prior to supporting deployment within a Private VPC, Cloud9 environments had to have a public IP address and the SSH port configured to be accessible from AWS Cloud9. Today AWS reinforced Cloud9's security posture by no longer requiring inbound connections to Cloud9 environments. This feature leverages AWS Systems Manager (SSM) to eliminate the need for SSH connections, and allows SSM to be the only ingress point into the underlying Cloud9 EC2 instances. This fits in line with CG's standards related to no public access by default.
<br>

**How?**<br>
Creation of Cloud9 resources that adhere to CG's current Security Standards and Controls will begin below with the creation of no-ingress EC2 instances. As mentioned previously this is a relativly new feature and helps CG enable public access restrictions on the service. 

1. **Creation of a  Non-Ingress EC2 Environment**<br>
In this section Cloud9 will create an EC2 instance, and then connects the environment to this newly created instance. AWS Cloud9 manages the lifecycle of this instance, including starting, stopping, and restarting the instance as needed. If you ever delete this environment, AWS Cloud9 automatically terminates this instance.<br><br>
   **Step 1:** Sign into your AWS account and navigate to the "Cloud9" service via the AWS search bar as below.<br>

   **Step 2:**

### 2. Cloud9 utilizes Managed Resource Policy to enforce least priviledge

`This Section will be updated soon.`

### 3. Cloud9 utilizes IAM Roles to enforce least priviledge

`This Section will be updated soon.`

### 4. Cloud9 connections are protected with TLS 1.2

`This Section will be updated soon.`

### 5. Cloud9 data is encrypted using CG managed KMS Keys

`This Section will be updated soon.`

## Capital Group Glossory 
**Data** - Digital pieces of information stored or transmitted for use with an information system from which understandable information is derived. Items that could be considered to be data are: Source code, meta-data, build artifacts, information input and output.  
 
**Information System** - An organized assembly of resources and procedures for the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information. All systems, platforms, compute instances including and not limited to physical and virtual client endpoints, physical and virtual servers, software containers, databases, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, network devices, applications (internal and external), Serverless computing instances (i.e. AWS Lambda), vendor provided appliances, and third-party platforms, connected to the Capital Group network or used by Capital Group users or customers.

**Log** - a record of the events occurring within information systems and networks. Logs are composed of log entries; each entry contains information related to a specific event that has occurred within a system or network.

**Information** - communication or representation of knowledge such as facts, data, or opinions in any medium or form, including textual, numerical, graphic, cartographic, narrative, or audiovisual. 

**Cloud computing** - A model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

**Vulnerability**  - Weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat source. Note: The term weakness is synonymous for deficiency. Weakness may result in security and/or privacy risks.
