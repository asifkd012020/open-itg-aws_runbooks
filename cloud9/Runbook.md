## Overview
AWS Cloud9 is an integrated development environment, or IDE. The AWS Cloud9 IDE offers a rich code-editing experience with support for several programming languages and runtime debuggers, and a built-in terminal. It contains a collection of tools that you use to code, build, run, test, and debug software, and helps you release software to the cloud.

You access the AWS Cloud9 IDE through a web browser. You can also configure the IDE to your preferences. You can switch color themes, bind shortcut keys, enable programming language-specific syntax coloring and code formatting, and more. Below is a diagram showing a standard secure deployment of Cloud9.

**The core features of Cloud9 allow developers to:**
 - Work with code in several programming languages and the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK).
 - Work with code in a running Docker container.
 - Use online code repositories.
 - Collaborate with others in real time.
 - Interact with various database and website technologies.
 - Targeting AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, and AWS Serverless Applications.
 - Taking advantage of other AWS products such as Amazon Lightsail, AWS CodeStar, and AWS CodePipeline.

### 1. Cloud9 deployed in Private VPC with no-ingress EC2 instances
Cloud9 as a service runs on top of EC2 instances in the backend, and this allows us to enforce public access controls as per the current CG cloud standards. This section details the process of deploying Cloud9 on EC2 instances in a private VPC on an internal subnet. 

**NIST CSF:** <br>

|NIST Subcategory Control|Description|
|-----------|------------------------|
|PR.PT-4|Communications and control networks are protected|
|PR.PT-5|Mechanisms (e.g., failsafe, load balancing, hot swap) are implemented to achieve resilience requirements in normal and adverse situations|
|PR.AC-3|Remote access is managed|
|PR.AC-5|Network integrity is protected (e.g., network segregation, network segmentation)|
<br>

**Capital Group:** <br>

|Control Statement|Description|
|------|----------------------|
|6|Any AWS service used by CG should not be directly available to the Internet and the default route is always the CG gateway.|
|7|Use of AWS IAM accounts are restricted to CG networks.|
