## Overview
AWS Database Migration Service helps you migrate databases to AWS quickly and securely. The source database remains fully operational during the migration, minimizing downtime to applications that rely on the database. The AWS Database Migration Service can migrate your data to and from most widely used commercial and open-source databases.

AWS Database Migration Service supports homogeneous migrations such as Oracle to Oracle, as well as heterogeneous migrations between different database platforms, such as Oracle or Microsoft SQL Server to Amazon Aurora. With AWS Database Migration Service, you can continuously replicate your data with high availability and consolidate databases into a petabyte-scale data warehouse by streaming data to Amazon Redshift and Amazon S3.

## Preventative Controls

### 1. DMS deployed using VPC Endpoints to prevent public access
AWS DMS currently supports VPC Interface Endpoints, and as such allows the service to meet CG's stringent Public Access control requirements.
<br>

**NIST CSF:** <br>

|NIST Subcategory Control|Description|
|-----------|------------------------|
|PR.PT-4|Communications and control networks are protected|
|PR.PT-5|Mechanisms (e.g., failsafe, load balancing, hot swap) are implemented to achieve resilience requirements in normal and adverse situations|
|PR.AC-3|Remote access is managed|
|PR.AC-5|Network integrity is protected (e.g., network segregation, network segmentation)|
<br>

**Capital Group:** <br>

|Control Statement|Description|
|------|----------------------|
|6|Any AWS service used by CG should not be directly available to the Internet and the default route is always the CG gateway.|
|7|Use of AWS IAM accounts are restricted to CG networks.|
<br>

**Why?**<br>
DMS is a service that allows for the migration of data between both AWS Databases and On-Premisis databases to AWS. Due to the possibility of sensitive data being stored and processed through DMS, We need to make sure that this traffic is not transmitted directly over the Public Internet. 
<br>

**How?**<br>
Establishing a private connection between your virtual private cloud (VPC) and the Amazon DMS service, you should create an interface VPC endpoint. You can use this connection to call the Amazon DMS service from your VPC without sending traffic over the Internet. The endpoint provides secure connectivity to the Amazon DMS service without requiring an Internet gateway (IGW), NAT instance, or virtual private network (VPN) connection.

Interface VPC endpoints are powered by AWS PrivateLink, a feature that enables private communication between AWS services using private IP addresses. To use AWS PrivateLink, create an interface VPC endpoint for Amazon DMS in your VPC using the Amazon VPC console, API, or CLI. Doing this creates an elastic network interface in your subnet with a private IP address that serves Amazon DMS requests. You can also access a VPC endpoint from on-premises environments or from other VPCs using AWS VPN, AWS Direct Connect, or VPC peering.

Below are the steps to implement Interface VPC Endpoints for DMS:

**Creation of Interface VPC Endpoint**
  1. Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/, and choose Endpoints from the navigation pane at left.
  2. Choose Create Endpoint.
     - For Service category, choose AWS service. 
     - For Service Name, choose Config in your AWS Region (for example, `com.amazonaws.us-east-1.dms`).
     - Then choose the VPC, if it does not already exist follow this [link](https://github.com/open-itg/aws_runbooks/blob/master/vpc/RUNBOOK.md) for instructions on how to create a new VPC. 
     - Select a security group for AWS Config, if the default security group will not suffice then follow this [link](https://github.com/open-itg/aws_runbooks/blob/master/vpc/RUNBOOK.md) for instructions on how to create a new Security Group. 
     - Make sure that you `Enable` the Enable Private DNS Name check box.
     - Now add the appropriate `CG standard tags`.
  4. Click `Create Endpoint` to complete the process.

### 4. AWS DMS replication instance should have Minor version automatic upgrade enabled

***Why?** This control checks whether ‘Minor version automatic upgrade’ is enabled for the AWS DMS replication instance. 

Enabling ‘Minor version automatic upgrade’ ensures that the latest minor version updates to DMS replication instance are installed during the maintenance window. These updates might include OS patching, security patches and bug fixes. Keeping up-to-date with patch installation is an important step in securing systems.

**How?** Enable DMS replication instance ‘Minor version automatic upgrade’
To enable this option from the AWS CLI, use the Amazon DMS ‘modify-replication-instance’ command to set the --auto-minor-version-upgrade attribute.
aws dms modify-replication-instance --replication-instance-arn <replication-instance-arn> --auto-minor-version-upgrade True
To modify a replication instance by using the AWS console
1.	Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS DMS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/dms/v2/
2.	In the navigation pane, choose Replication instances.
3.	Choose the replication instance you want to modify. The following modifications you can make.

Minor version automatic upgrade: Choose this option to have minor engine upgrades applied automatically to the replication instance during the maintenance window

When you modify a replication instance, you can apply the changes immediately. To apply changes immediately, choose the ‘Apply changes immediately’ option in the AWS Management Console. Or use the --apply-immediately parameter when calling the AWS CLI.
