## Overview
Forecasting is the process of making models/predictions based on past and present data by analysis of trends. Amazon Forecast is a fully managed service that helps predict accurate time-series forecasts by using machine learning and statistical algorithms.

Time-series forecasting is useful in multiple fields, including retail, finance, logistics, and healthcare. You can also use Forecast to predict domain-specific metrics for your inventory, workforce, web traffic, server capacity, finances, etc.

**Features & Benefits**
 - Automated machine learning
 - State-of-the-art algorithms
 - Missing value support
 - Built-in featurizations
  
 **NOTE:** <br>
>`Forecast is an AWS Managed service offering, the underlying Infrastructure including Network and Compute resources are all managed by AWS as explained in the Shared Responsibility Model. Due to this fact, CG's standard public access controls cannot be applied and the application of appropriate controls to keep the service from external or public accessibility falls on AWS. The IAM and Encryption controls however remain CG's responsibility and are listed in the sections below.`

## Capital Group Glossory 
**Data** - Digital pieces of information stored or transmitted for use with an information system from which understandable information is derived. Items that could be considered to be data are: Source code, meta-data, build artifacts, information input and output.  
 
**Information System** - An organized assembly of resources and procedures for the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information. All systems, platforms, compute instances including and not limited to physical and virtual client endpoints, physical and virtual servers, software containers, databases, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, network devices, applications (internal and external), Serverless computing instances (i.e. AWS Lambda), vendor provided appliances, and third-party platforms, connected to the Capital Group network or used by Capital Group users or customers.

**Log** - a record of the events occurring within information systems and networks. Logs are composed of log entries; each entry contains information related to a specific event that has occurred within a system or network.

**Information** - communication or representation of knowledge such as facts, data, or opinions in any medium or form, including textual, numerical, graphic, cartographic, narrative, or audiovisual. 

**Cloud computing** - A model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

**Vulnerability**  - Weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat source. Note: The term weakness is synonymous for deficiency. Weakness may result in security and/or privacy risks.
