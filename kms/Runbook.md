## Overview
AWS Key Management Service (KMS) makes it easy for you to create and manage cryptographic keys and control their use across a wide range of AWS services and in your applications. AWS KMS is a secure and resilient service that uses hardware security modules that have been validated under FIPS 140-2, or are in the process of being validated, to protect your keys. AWS KMS is integrated with AWS CloudTrail to provide you with logs of all key usage to help meet your regulatory and compliance needs.

AWS KMS provides you with centralized control over the lifecycle and permissions of your keys. You can create new keys whenever you wish, and you can control who can manage keys versus who can use them. KMS also allows for the secure import of keys from CG's own key management infrastructure, or use keys stored in CG's AWS CloudHSM cluster allowing services to adhere to CG's encryption standards. Below ias an exaple of how KMS is used for key storage and retrieval.

### 1. KMS roles defined following least privilege model

**Why?**

Given that our CMKs are being used to protect CG's sensitive information, one should work to ensure that the corresponding key policies follow a model of least privilege. Assigning the minimum permissions to access key material will allow for better and more secure management of sensitive data in the cloud. The next section will detail how to best secure access to CG's CMK's stored in KMS.

**How?**

Applying the pricipal of least privilege to key access includes ensuring that you do **NOT** include kms:* permissions in an IAM policy. This policy would grant the principal both administrative and usage permissions on all CMKs to which the principal has access. Similarly, including kms:* permissions for the principals within your key policy gives them both administrative and usage permissions on the CMK. Below are a few items that need to be taken into account when setting up KMS in a new account.
 - Key Policy
 - Cross Account Key Access

## Capital Group Glossory 
**Data** - Digital pieces of information stored or transmitted for use with an information system from which understandable information is derived. Items that could be considered to be data are: Source code, meta-data, build artifacts, information input and output.  
 
**Information System** - An organized assembly of resources and procedures for the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information. All systems, platforms, compute instances including and not limited to physical and virtual client endpoints, physical and virtual servers, software containers, databases, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, network devices, applications (internal and external), Serverless computing instances (i.e. AWS Lambda), vendor provided appliances, and third-party platforms, connected to the Capital Group network or used by Capital Group users or customers.

**Log** - a record of the events occurring within information systems and networks. Logs are composed of log entries; each entry contains information related to a specific event that has occurred within a system or network.

**Information** - communication or representation of knowledge such as facts, data, or opinions in any medium or form, including textual, numerical, graphic, cartographic, narrative, or audiovisual. 

**Cloud computing** - A model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

**Vulnerability**  - Weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat source. Note: The term weakness is synonymous for deficiency. Weakness may result in security and/or privacy risks.
