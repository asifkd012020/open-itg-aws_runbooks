## Overview
AWS CloudFormation is a service that helps you model and set up your Amazon Web Services resources so that you can spend less time managing those resources and more time focusing on your applications that run in AWS. You create a template that describes all the AWS resources that you want (like Amazon EC2 instances or Amazon RDS DB instances), and CloudFormation takes care of provisioning and configuring those resources for you. You don't need to individually create and configure AWS resources and figure out what's dependent on what; CloudFormation handles that. The following scenarios demonstrate how CloudFormation can help.

### 1. CloudFormation Utilizes VPC Endpoints to Prevent Public Access
Following CG's stringent cloud security controls, you should establish a private connection between your VPC and CloudFormation. You can use this connection to enable CloudFormation to communicate with your resources on your VPC without going through the public internet.

<br>

**Why?**<br>
CG has stringent cloud security controls around how services need to be secured, so that they are not publicly accessible. One of the ways to ensure that a service is only accessible to CG networks is to deploy the service using VPC Interface Endpoints.

**How?**<br>
When establishing a private connection between your virtual private cloud (VPC) and the Amazon CloudFormation service, you should create an interface VPC endpoint. You can use this connection to call the Amazon CloudFormation service from your VPC without sending traffic over the Internet. The endpoint provides secure connectivity to the Amazon CloudFormation service without requiring an Internet gateway (IGW), NAT instance, or virtual private network (VPN) connection.

Interface VPC endpoints are powered by AWS PrivateLink, a feature that enables private communication between AWS services using private IP addresses. To use AWS PrivateLink, create an interface VPC endpoint for Amazon CloudFormation in your VPC using the Amazon VPC console, API, or CLI. Doing this creates an elastic network interface in your subnet with a private IP address that serves Amazon CloudFormation requests. You can also access a VPC endpoint from on-premises environments or from other VPCs using AWS VPN, AWS Direct Connect, or VPC peering. 

### Before Setting up Interface VPC Endpoints for CloudFormation:

*Please be aware of the following consideration:*
 - When using the VPC endpoint feature, grant access to CloudFormation-specific S3 buckets for resources in a VPC that must respond to a custom resource request or a wait condition. If you use CloudFormation to create resources in a VPC with a VPC endpoint, you might need to modify your IAM endpoint policy so that it permits access to certain S3 buckets. CloudFormation has S3 buckets in each Region to monitor responses to a custom resource request or a wait condition. If a template includes custom resources or wait conditions in a VPC, the VPC endpoint policy must allow users to send responses to the following buckets:
   - For custom resources, permit traffic to the cloudformation-custom-resource-response-region bucket. When using custom resources, region names don't contain dashes. For example, uswest2.
   - For wait conditions, permit traffic to the cloudformation-waitcondition-region bucket. When using wait conditions, region names do contain dashes. For example, us-west-2.

   If the endpoint policy blocks traffic to these buckets, CloudFormation won't receive responses and the stack operation fails. For example, if you have a resource in a VPC in the us-west-2 Region that must respond to a wait condition, the resource must be able to send a response to the cloudformation-waitcondition-us-west-2 bucket.

    For a list of Regions that CloudFormation supports, see the Regions and endpoints page in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.

 - VPC endpoints currently don't support cross-Region requestsâ€” ensure that you create your endpoint in the same Region in which you plan to issue your API calls to CloudFormation.

- VPC endpoints only support Amazon-provided DNS through Route 53. If you want to use your own DNS, you can use conditional DNS forwarding. For more information, see DHCP options sets in the Amazon VPC User Guide.

 - The security group attached to the VPC endpoint must allow incoming connections on port 443 from the private subnet of the VPC.

### Below are the steps to implement Interface VPC Endpoints for CloudFormation:

**Creation of Interface VPC Endpoint:**
  1. Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/, and choose Endpoints from the navigation pane at left.
  2. Choose Create Endpoint.
     - For Service category, choose AWS service. 
     - For Service Name, choose Config in your AWS Region (for example, `com.amazonaws.us-east-1.cloudformation`).
     - Then choose the VPC, if it does not already exist follow this [link](https://github.com/open-itg/aws_runbooks/blob/master/vpc/RUNBOOK.md) for instructions on how to create a new VPC. 
     - Select a security group for AWS Config, if the default security group will not suffice then follow this [link](https://github.com/open-itg/aws_runbooks/blob/master/vpc/RUNBOOK.md) for instructions on how to create a new Security Group. 
     - Make sure that you `Enable` the Enable Private DNS Name check box.
     - Now add the appropriate `CG standard tags`.
  4. Click `Create Endpoint` to complete the process.
  5. The CloudFormation service will now be accessible via the private endpoint for all requests within the VPC.
