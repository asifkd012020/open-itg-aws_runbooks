## Overview
Amazon Cognito is a managed service that allows you to quickly add users for your mobile and web applications by providing in-built sign-in screens and authentication functionality. It handles security, authorization, and synchronization for your user management process across devices for all your users. You can use Cognito for authenticating your users through external identity providers including social identity providers, such as Facebook, Google, Twitter, LinkedIn, and so on. Cognito can also be used to authenticate identities for any solution that is compatible with SAML 2.0 standard. You can provide temporary security credentials with limited privileges to these authenticated users to securely access your AWS resources. 

The following figure illustrates the basic functionalities of Amazon Cognito:

### 1. Cognito User Pools utilize OKTA as Identity Provider
Amazon Cognito user pools allow sign-in through third party federation, including through an IdP, such as Okta. A user pool integrated with Okta allows users in your Okta app to get user pool tokens from Amazon Cognito alowing access. 

**NIST CSF:**
|NIST Subcategory Control|Description|
|-----------|------------------------|
|PR.AC-1|Identities and credentials are issued, managed, verified, revoked, and audited for authorized devices, users and processes|
|PR.AC-4|Access permissions and authorizations are managed, incorporating the principles of least privilege and separation of duties|
|PR.AC-7|Users, devices, and other assets are authenticated (e.g., single-factor, multi-factor) commensurate with the risk of the transaction (e.g., individuals’ security and privacy risks and other organizational risks)|
|PR.PT-3|The principle of least functionality is incorporated by configuring systems to provide only essential capabilities|

**Capital Group:**
|Control Statement|Description|
|------|----------------------|
|5|AWS IAM User accounts are only to be created for use by services or products that do not support IAM Roles. Services are not allowed to create local accounts for human use within the service. All human user authentication will take place within CG’s Identity Provider.|
|8|AWS IAM User secrets, including passwords and secret access keys, are to be rotated every 90 days. Accounts created locally within any service must also have their secrets rotated every 90 days.|
|10|Administrative access to AWS resources will have MFA enabled|
<br>

**Why?**

CG's current standards require the use of OKTA as our Identity Provider for login to cloud resources, fortunatly AWS Cognito allows federation via SAML 2.0 or OIDC with OKTA. This allows users in CG's directory to access Cognito backed services through a signon via OKTA and allows CG adminitration of access through a single tool.

**How?**

As mentioned previously one can integrate OKTA directly from a user pool.

 1. The app starts the sign-up and sign-in process by directing your user to the UI hosted by AWS. A mobile app can use web view to show the pages hosted by AWS.

 2. Typically your user pool determines the identity provider for your user from that user's email address.

 3. Alternatively, if your app gathered information before directing the user to your user pool, it can provide that information to Amazon Cognito through a query parameter.

 4. Your user is redirected to OKTA, the IdP.

 5. OKTA authenticates the user if necessary. If OKTA recognizes that the user has an active session, then OKTA skips the authentication to provide a single sign-in (SSO) experience.

 6. OKTA POSTs the SAML assertion to the Amazon Cognito service.

 7. After verifying the SAML assertion and collecting the user attributes (claims) from the assertion, Amazon Cognito internally creates or updates the user's profile in the userpool. Amazon Cognito returns OIDC tokens to the app for the now signed-in user.

The following diagram shows the authentication flow for this process:

**Data** - Digital pieces of information stored or transmitted for use with an information system from which understandable information is derived. Items that could be considered to be data are: Source code, meta-data, build artifacts, information input and output.  
 
**Information System** - An organized assembly of resources and procedures for the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information. All systems, platforms, compute instances including and not limited to physical and virtual client endpoints, physical and virtual servers, software containers, databases, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, network devices, applications (internal and external), Serverless computing instances (i.e. AWS Lambda), vendor provided appliances, and third-party platforms, connected to the Capital Group network or used by Capital Group users or customers.

**Log** - a record of the events occurring within information systems and networks. Logs are composed of log entries; each entry contains information related to a specific event that has occurred within a system or network.

**Information** - communication or representation of knowledge such as facts, data, or opinions in any medium or form, including textual, numerical, graphic, cartographic, narrative, or audiovisual. 

**Cloud computing** - A model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

**Vulnerability**  - Weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat source. Note: The term weakness is synonymous for deficiency. Weakness may result in security and/or privacy risks.
