## Overview
AWS Billing and Cost Management is the service that you use to pay your AWS bill, monitor your usage, and analyze and control your costs. AWS automatically charges the credit card that you provided when you signed up for a new account with AWS. Charges appear on your monthly credit card bill. You can view or update your credit card information, including designating a different credit card for AWS to charge, on the Payment Methods page in the Billing and Cost Management console. AWS Billing and Cost Management provides useful tools to help you gather information related to your cost and usage, analyze your cost drivers and usage trends, and take action to budget your spending.

**Cost Explorer:** The AWS Billing and Cost Management console includes the no-cost Cost Explorer tool for viewing your AWS cost data as a graph. With Cost Explorer, you can filter graphs by values such as API operation, Availability Zone, AWS service, custom cost allocation tag, Amazon EC2 instance type, purchase option, AWS Region, usage type, usage type group, and more. If you use consolidated billing, you can also filter by member account. In addition, you can see a forecast of future costs based on your historical cost data.

**Budgets:** You can use AWS Budgets to track your AWS usage and costs. Budgets use the cost visualization provided by Cost Explorer to show you the status of your budgets. This provides forecasts of your estimated costs and tracks your AWS usage, including your free tier usage. You can also use budgets to create Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) notifications that tell you when you go over your budgeted amounts, or when your estimated costs exceed your budgets.C

**Note:** *The review of Billing and Cost Management includes the following sub components that have been reviewed for use: Cost Explorer, Budgets and Cost & Billing Reports.*

## Preventative Controls

### 1. IAM Policies for Billing and Cost Management
Billing and Cost Management as with many AWS PaaS and SaaS services do not usually allow for the service to be built within a Private VPC, and therefore Identity and Access Management (IAM) controls may be the only true option for securing access to the service and the data stored within.

**NIST CSF:** <br>

|NIST Subcategory Control|Description|
|-----------|------------------------|
|PR.AC-1|Identities and credentials are issued, managed, verified, revoked, and audited for authorized devices, users and processes|
|PR.AC-4|Access permissions and authorizations are managed, incorporating the principles of least privilege and separation of duties|
|PR.AC-7|Users, devices, and other assets are authenticated (e.g., single-factor, multi-factor) commensurate with the risk of the transaction (e.g., individuals’ security and privacy risks and other organizational risks)|
|PR.PT-3|The principle of least functionality is incorporated by configuring systems to provide only essential capabilities|
<br>

**Capital Group:** <br>

|Control Statement|Description|
|------|----------------------|
|5|AWS IAM User accounts are only to be created for use by services or products that do not support IAM Roles. Services are not allowed to create local accounts for human use within the service. All human user authentication will take place within CG’s Identity Provider.|
|8|AWS IAM User secrets, including passwords and secret access keys, are to be rotated every 90 days. Accounts created locally within any service must also have their secrets rotated every 90 days.|
|10|Administrative access to AWS resources will have MFA enabled|
<br>

**Why?**<br>
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) as mentioned before is the primary control applied to Billing and Cost Management that allows an administrator the ability to assign permissions based on a per user or role, depending on business need. 
<br>

**How?**<br>
Assignment of permissions should be alligned to CG's standards for access and based on business need. The diagram below shows how the Organizational Management Account is the root of permissions.<br>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/docs/img/billingCost/iam_ex.png" width="600"></p>

<br>

The grouping of permissions should be at minimum split into the following categories of permissions:

1. **Organization Management Account Owner**<br>
 Management account owner	The person or entity associated with an AWS Organizations management account. The management account pays for AWS usage that is incurred by a member account in an organization. Currently this role is reserved for the Platform Design Team.
    ```
    - Has full control of all Billing and Cost Management resources for the management account only.
    - Receives a monthly invoice of AWS charges for the management account and member accounts.
    - Views the activity of member accounts in the billing reports for the management account.
    ```
    
 2. **Organization Member Account Owner**<br>
 The person or entity associated with an AWS Organizations member account. The management account pays for AWS usage that is incurred by a member account in an organization. This role will be assigned to the Application Owner, or Product Owner on a specific AWS account.
    ```
    - Doesn't have permission to review any usage reports or account activity except for its own. 
    - Doesn't have access to usage reports or account activity for other member accounts in the organization.
    - Doesn't have access to usage reports or account activity for the management account.
    - Doesn't have permission to view billing reports.
    - Has permission to update account information only for its own account.
    ```
 3. **Organization Member Account IAM User**<br>
 A person or application defined as a user in a member account by an account owner or administrative user. Accounts can contain multiple IAM users.
    ```
    - Has permissions explicitly granted to the user or a group that includes the user.
    - Can be granted permission to view Billing and Cost Management console pages.
    ```

**Information System** - An organized assembly of resources and procedures for the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information. All systems, platforms, compute instances including and not limited to physical and virtual client endpoints, physical and virtual servers, software containers, databases, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, network devices, applications (internal and external), Serverless computing instances (i.e. AWS Lambda), vendor provided appliances, and third-party platforms, connected to the Capital Group network or used by Capital Group users or customers.

**Log** - a record of the events occurring within information systems and networks. Logs are composed of log entries; each entry contains information related to a specific event that has occurred within a system or network.

**Information** - communication or representation of knowledge such as facts, data, or opinions in any medium or form, including textual, numerical, graphic, cartographic, narrative, or audiovisual. 

**Cloud computing** - A model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

**Vulnerability**  - Weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat source. Note: The term weakness is synonymous for deficiency. Weakness may result in security and/or privacy risks.
