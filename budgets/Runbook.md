## Overview
AWS Billing and Cost Management is the service that you use to pay your AWS bill, monitor your usage, and analyze and control your costs. AWS automatically charges the credit card that you provided when you signed up for a new account with AWS. Charges appear on your monthly credit card bill. You can view or update your credit card information, including designating a different credit card for AWS to charge, on the Payment Methods page in the Billing and Cost Management console. AWS Billing and Cost Management provides useful tools to help you gather information related to your cost and usage, analyze your cost drivers and usage trends, and take action to budget your spending.

**Cost Explorer:** The AWS Billing and Cost Management console includes the no-cost Cost Explorer tool for viewing your AWS cost data as a graph. With Cost Explorer, you can filter graphs by values such as API operation, Availability Zone, AWS service, custom cost allocation tag, Amazon EC2 instance type, purchase option, AWS Region, usage type, usage type group, and more. If you use consolidated billing, you can also filter by member account. In addition, you can see a forecast of future costs based on your historical cost data.

**Budgets:** You can use AWS Budgets to track your AWS usage and costs. Budgets use the cost visualization provided by Cost Explorer to show you the status of your budgets. This provides forecasts of your estimated costs and tracks your AWS usage, including your free tier usage. You can also use budgets to create Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) notifications that tell you when you go over your budgeted amounts, or when your estimated costs exceed your budgets.C

**Note:** *The review of Billing and Cost Management includes the following sub components that have been reviewed for use: Cost Explorer, Budgets and Cost & Billing Reports.*
