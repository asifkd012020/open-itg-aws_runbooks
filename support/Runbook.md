## Overview
AWS Support provides a mix of tools and technology, people, and programs designed to proactively help you optimize performance, lower costs, and innovate faster. We save time for your team by helping you to move faster in the cloud and focus on your core business. We are determined to make our customers successful on their cloud journey and address requests that range from answering best practices questions, guidance on configuration, all the way to break-fix and problem resolution.

On behalf of our customers, we are focused on solving some of the toughest challenges that hold you back in your cloud journey. Sometimes that means helping you troubleshoot an issue, but more often, it involves "looking around corners" to find ways for you to better utilize AWS services, answer best practices questions, and provide guidance on configuration. We focus on helping you achieve the outcomes you need to make your business successful. It is our approach to Support that sets AWS apart.

**NOTE:** <br>
>`AWS Support is an AWS Managed service offering, the underlying Infrastructure including Network and Compute resources are all managed by AWS as explained in the Shared Responsibility Model. Due to this fact, CG's standard public access controls cannot be applied and the application of appropriate controls to keep the service from external or public accessibility falls on AWS, as do the Encryption and Key Management Controls. The IAM controls however remain CG's responsibility and are listed in the sections below.`

All systems, platforms, compute instances including and not limited to physical and virtual client endpoints, physical and virtual servers, software containers, databases, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, network devices, applications (internal and external), Serverless computing instances (i.e. AWS Lambda), vendor provided appliances, and third-party platforms, connected to the Capital Group network or used by Capital Group users or customers.

**Cloud computing** - A model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

**Vulnerability**  - Weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat source. Note: The term weakness is synonymous for deficiency. Weakness may result in security and/or privacy risks.
