# AWS Service Request Process
The following page serves to document the details around requesting a new AWS service and the Requirements, Process and Timelines associated with each request. Please check this page each time a new service is requested as process details may change as new requirements are added. The output of the process is the approval or denial of the service that was requested with review artifacts being the associated service runbook, initial rules and GRC control mappings.

## Requirements
This section aims to provide detailed information relate to the core / baseline security requirements that need to be satisfied for a new service to be introduced. These requirements may or may not be applicable to all services and some services may require specialized controls.

### Public Access
<img src="/docs/img/round_transfer_within_a_station_black_48dp.png" width="48"/>
The first and arguably the most important control that we look at when a new service is requested is the Public Accessibility of the service, usually related to PaaS and IaaS but could also include SaaS service offerings. There are many baseline controls available to lock down public access to services, below is a list of the core public access controls we look at right out the gate.

**SCP Policy:**

If possible the first option to look at from an AWS organizational perspective is a public access block through AWS Service Control Policy (SCP), this allows a default denial of public access and therefore does not put undue burden on the service user. This option can be enforced across all CG accounts in one place, and allows the SCP to be easily managed. An example of a default public block policy is for the Simple Storage service (S3).

**Private VPC:**

All new services should by default be deployed within a CG owned Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), with no default ingress / egress route to the internet via an internet gateway, and with no default public IP address assignments set. The private vpc deployment is key to the security of CG's cloud services and all associated subnets, gateways and resources being built within a vpc will need to adhere to the private resouce policy by default.

**Security Group / Access-List (ACL):**

All new services will be reviewed should by default have a firewall, Security Group or ACL controlling acccess to and from CG resources even within a private VPC. This provides a defense in depth layered approach to securing services, and provides one further layer between public access due to misconfigureation. These controls should be applied using the principal of least priviledge and as such only allow the network access required to run the service.

**Other:**

Based on the availability of the above public access controls, other service specific controls may play a role related to the approval of the requested service. Not all services have controls over and above SCP, Security Group / ACL or Private VPC, so this review will be case-by-case.

### Encryption
As with Public Access control, Encryption is another key Security Control that we have in our toolkit to ensure CG's data in the cloud is only accessible to those that need and should have access to our data.  The subsections below will detail the various encryption methods that will be looked at when reviewing a service for use.

**CloudHSM BYOK Encryption:**

The first and arguably the most secure way to manage encyption keys comes with service integration with CloudHSM, this is usually used when key auditability is a must and is usually used in association with highly sensitive data as the cost is high. This will be one of the Encryption technologies investigated when reviewing a service for use.

**KMS BYOK Encryption:**

The second most secure way to manage encyption keys comes with service integration with AWS KMS using Customer Managed Keys, this is the CG standard and usually used when key availability and ease of use are core requirements, with the cost being relativly low. This will be one of the Encryption technologies investigated when reviewing a service for use.

**Provider Key Encryption:**

The third way to manage encyption keys comes with service integration with AWS KMS using provider generated keys, this would be our least prefered method of key management and usually used when none of the other key management techniques are available for a service, with the cost being very low. This will be one of the Encryption technologies investigated when reviewing a service, and depending on the data being stored may be a deal-breaker on service use.

**Other:**

Some services may offer service specific encryption options sucha as record level encryption or in-memory encryption, where the service may not use physical storage and is short lived.  These options will be reviewed on a per service basis, as the above encryption options may not be available, but the service meets the spirit of data encryption.
