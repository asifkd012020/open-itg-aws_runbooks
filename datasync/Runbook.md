## Overview
AWS DataSync is an online data transfer service that simplifies, automates, and accelerates moving data between on-premises storage systems and AWS storage services, and also between AWS storage services. DataSync can copy data between Network File System (NFS), Server Message Block (SMB) file servers, self-managed object storage, AWS Snowcone, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets, Amazon EFS file systems, and Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file systems.

### Deployment Example:
<img src="/docs/img/datasync/ds_example.png" width="800"><br>

### Benefits:
 - **Simplify and automate data movement** – AWS DataSync makes it easier to move data over the network between on-premises storage and AWS storage services, and also between AWS storage services. DataSync automates both the management of data transfer processes and the infrastructure required for high-performance and secure data transfer.

 - **Transfer data securely** – DataSync provides end-to-end security, including encryption and integrity validation, to help ensure that your data arrives securely, intact, and ready to use. DataSync accesses your AWS storage using built-in AWS security mechanisms such as AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles. It also supports VPC endpoints, giving you the option to transfer data without traversing the public internet, and further increasing the security of data copied online.

 - **Move data faster** – With DataSync, you can transfer data rapidly over the network into AWS. It uses a purpose-built network protocol and a parallel, multi-threaded architecture to accelerate your transfers. This speeds up migrations, recurring data processing workflows for analytics and machine learning, and data protection processes.

 - **Reduce operational costs** – You can move data cost-effectively with the flat, per-gigabyte pricing of DataSync. You can save on script development, and deployment and maintenance costs, and avoid the need for costly commercial transfer tools.

### 1. DataSync Utilizes VPC Endpoints to Prevent Public Access
AWS DataSync currently supports VPC Endpoints, and as such allows the service to meet CG's stringent Public Access control requirements.
<br>

**NIST CSF:** <br>

|NIST Subcategory Control|Description|
|-----------|------------------------|
|PR.PT-4|Communications and control networks are protected|
|PR.PT-5|Mechanisms (e.g., failsafe, load balancing, hot swap) are implemented to achieve resilience requirements in normal and adverse situations|
|PR.AC-3|Remote access is managed|
|PR.AC-5|Network integrity is protected (e.g., network segregation, network segmentation)|
<br>

**Capital Group:** <br>

|Control Statement|Description|
|------|----------------------|
|6|Any AWS service used by CG should not be directly available to the Internet and the default route is always the CG gateway.|
|7|Use of AWS IAM accounts are restricted to CG networks.|
<br>

**Why?**<br>
DataSync is a service that allows for the transfer of data between On-Premesis Storage and AWS Storage Services, or AWS to AWS Storage Services. Due to the possibility of sensitive data being transfered with DataSync, We need to make sure that this traffic is not transmitted directly over the public Internet. 
<br>

**How?**<br>
The DataSync agent transfers data between self-managed storage and AWS. You deploy the DataSync agent as a virtual machine in the same local CG network as your source storage. This approach minimizes network overhead associated with transferring data using network protocols such as Network File System (NFS) and Server Message Block (SMB), or when accessing your self-managed object storage using the Amazon S3 API. Below we will detail the process to implement DataSync via Private VPC Endpoint, and can be visualized with the diagram shown next.

**PART 1 - Configuring DataSync with VPC Endpoint**<br>
- **Start:**<br>
  - Please select DataSync from the AWS Services bar as seen below to begin.<br>
  <img src="/docs/img/datasync/ds_search.png" width="600">

  - Next, select the type of transfer either `Between AWS Storage Services` or `Between on-Prem and AWS Storage Services` and click **Get Started**. If you are migrating data between on-prem and AWS, at this point, please [goto Part 2](#PART-2-Creating-a-DataSync-Agent-On-Premesis) to continue.
  <img src="/docs/img/datasync/get_started.png" width="600">

- **Step 1:**<br>
Choose the `VPC` and `subnet` where you want to set up the DataSync private IP addresses. The default VPC and Subnets can be used, as long as they do not contain any direct Internet access through an IGW or the likes. If a new VPC is needed , please see the following: [VPC Runbook](https://github.com/open-itg/aws_runbooks/blob/master/vpc/RUNBOOK.md)<br>

## Capital Group Glossory 
**Data** - Digital pieces of information stored or transmitted for use with an information system from which understandable information is derived. Items that could be considered to be data are: Source code, meta-data, build artifacts, information input and output.  
 
**Information System** - An organized assembly of resources and procedures for the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information. All systems, platforms, compute instances including and not limited to physical and virtual client endpoints, physical and virtual servers, software containers, databases, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, network devices, applications (internal and external), Serverless computing instances (i.e. AWS Lambda), vendor provided appliances, and third-party platforms, connected to the Capital Group network or used by Capital Group users or customers.

**Log** - a record of the events occurring within information systems and networks. Logs are composed of log entries; each entry contains information related to a specific event that has occurred within a system or network.

**Information** - communication or representation of knowledge such as facts, data, or opinions in any medium or form, including textual, numerical, graphic, cartographic, narrative, or audiovisual. 

**Cloud computing** - A model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

**Vulnerability**  - Weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat source. Note: The term weakness is synonymous for deficiency. Weakness may result in security and/or privacy risks.
