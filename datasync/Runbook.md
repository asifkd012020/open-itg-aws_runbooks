## Overview
AWS DataSync is an online data transfer service that simplifies, automates, and accelerates moving data between on-premises storage systems and AWS storage services, and also between AWS storage services. DataSync can copy data between Network File System (NFS), Server Message Block (SMB) file servers, self-managed object storage, AWS Snowcone, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets, Amazon EFS file systems, and Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file systems.

### Deployment Example:

### Benefits:
 - **Simplify and automate data movement** – AWS DataSync makes it easier to move data over the network between on-premises storage and AWS storage services, and also between AWS storage services. DataSync automates both the management of data transfer processes and the infrastructure required for high-performance and secure data transfer.

 - **Transfer data securely** – DataSync provides end-to-end security, including encryption and integrity validation, to help ensure that your data arrives securely, intact, and ready to use. DataSync accesses your AWS storage using built-in AWS security mechanisms such as AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles. It also supports VPC endpoints, giving you the option to transfer data without traversing the public internet, and further increasing the security of data copied online.

 - **Move data faster** – With DataSync, you can transfer data rapidly over the network into AWS. It uses a purpose-built network protocol and a parallel, multi-threaded architecture to accelerate your transfers. This speeds up migrations, recurring data processing workflows for analytics and machine learning, and data protection processes.

 - **Reduce operational costs** – You can move data cost-effectively with the flat, per-gigabyte pricing of DataSync. You can save on script development, and deployment and maintenance costs, and avoid the need for costly commercial transfer tools.

## Preventative Controls
<img src="/docs/img/Prevent.png" width="50">

AWS DataSync as with many AWS Managed Services by nature do not usually allow for the service to be built within a Private VPC, and therefore Identity and Access Management (IAM) controls may be the only true option for securing access to the service and the data stored within.

**NIST CSF:** <br>

|NIST Subcategory Control|Description|
|-----------|------------------------|
|PR.AC-1|Identities and credentials are issued, managed, verified, revoked, and audited for authorized devices, users and processes|
|PR.AC-4|Access permissions and authorizations are managed, incorporating the principles of least privilege and separation of duties|
|PR.AC-7|Users, devices, and other assets are authenticated (e.g., single-factor, multi-factor) commensurate with the risk of the transaction (e.g., individuals’ security and privacy risks and other organizational risks)|
|PR.PT-3|The principle of least functionality is incorporated by configuring systems to provide only essential capabilities|
<br>

**Capital Group:** <br>

|Control Statement|Description|
|------|----------------------|
|5|AWS IAM User accounts are only to be created for use by services or products that do not support IAM Roles. Services are not allowed to create local accounts for human use within the service. All human user authentication will take place within CG’s Identity Provider.|
|8|AWS IAM User secrets, including passwords and secret access keys, are to be rotated every 90 days. Accounts created locally within any service must also have their secrets rotated every 90 days.|
|10|Administrative access to AWS resources will have MFA enabled|
<br>

**Why?**<br>
DataSync is a service that allows for the transfer of data between On-Premesis Storage and AWS Storage Services. Due to the possibility of sensitive data being transfered with DataSync, one needs to implement levels of privilege and have authorization mechanisms in place to enforce the separation of privileges, and mandate multi-factor authentication or similar protections based on sensitivity.
<br>

**How?**<br>
Using IAM with AWS DataSync, you can control whether users in our organization can perform a task using specific API actions and whether they can use specific AWS resources.

## Capital Group Glossory 
**Data** - Digital pieces of information stored or transmitted for use with an information system from which understandable information is derived. Items that could be considered to be data are: Source code, meta-data, build artifacts, information input and output.  
 
**Information System** - An organized assembly of resources and procedures for the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information. All systems, platforms, compute instances including and not limited to physical and virtual client endpoints, physical and virtual servers, software containers, databases, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, network devices, applications (internal and external), Serverless computing instances (i.e. AWS Lambda), vendor provided appliances, and third-party platforms, connected to the Capital Group network or used by Capital Group users or customers.

**Log** - a record of the events occurring within information systems and networks. Logs are composed of log entries; each entry contains information related to a specific event that has occurred within a system or network.

**Information** - communication or representation of knowledge such as facts, data, or opinions in any medium or form, including textual, numerical, graphic, cartographic, narrative, or audiovisual. 

**Cloud computing** - A model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

**Vulnerability**  - Weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat source. Note: The term weakness is synonymous for deficiency. Weakness may result in security and/or privacy risks.
