## Overview
AWS DataSync is an online data transfer service that simplifies, automates, and accelerates moving data between on-premises storage systems and AWS storage services, and also between AWS storage services. DataSync can copy data between Network File System (NFS), Server Message Block (SMB) file servers, self-managed object storage, AWS Snowcone, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets, Amazon EFS file systems, and Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file systems.

### Deployment Example:
<img src="/docs/img/datasync/ds_example.png" width="800"><br>

### Benefits:
 - **Simplify and automate data movement** – AWS DataSync makes it easier to move data over the network between on-premises storage and AWS storage services, and also between AWS storage services. DataSync automates both the management of data transfer processes and the infrastructure required for high-performance and secure data transfer.

 - **Transfer data securely** – DataSync provides end-to-end security, including encryption and integrity validation, to help ensure that your data arrives securely, intact, and ready to use. DataSync accesses your AWS storage using built-in AWS security mechanisms such as AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles. It also supports VPC endpoints, giving you the option to transfer data without traversing the public internet, and further increasing the security of data copied online.

 - **Move data faster** – With DataSync, you can transfer data rapidly over the network into AWS. It uses a purpose-built network protocol and a parallel, multi-threaded architecture to accelerate your transfers. This speeds up migrations, recurring data processing workflows for analytics and machine learning, and data protection processes.

 - **Reduce operational costs** – You can move data cost-effectively with the flat, per-gigabyte pricing of DataSync. You can save on script development, and deployment and maintenance costs, and avoid the need for costly commercial transfer tools.

## Preventative Controls

### 1. DataSync Utilizes VPC Endpoints to Prevent Public Access
AWS DataSync currently supports VPC Endpoints, and as such allows the service to meet CG's stringent Public Access control requirements.
<br>

**NIST CSF:** <br>

|NIST Subcategory Control|Description|
|-----------|------------------------|
|PR.PT-4|Communications and control networks are protected|
|PR.PT-5|Mechanisms (e.g., failsafe, load balancing, hot swap) are implemented to achieve resilience requirements in normal and adverse situations|
|PR.AC-3|Remote access is managed|
|PR.AC-5|Network integrity is protected (e.g., network segregation, network segmentation)|
<br>

**Capital Group:** <br>

|Control Statement|Description|
|------|----------------------|
|6|Any AWS service used by CG should not be directly available to the Internet and the default route is always the CG gateway.|
|7|Use of AWS IAM accounts are restricted to CG networks.|
<br>

**Why?**<br>
DataSync is a service that allows for the transfer of data between On-Premesis Storage and AWS Storage Services, or AWS to AWS Storage Services. Due to the possibility of sensitive data being transfered with DataSync, We need to make sure that this traffic is not transmitted directly over the public Internet. 
<br>

**How?**<br>
The DataSync agent transfers data between self-managed storage and AWS. You deploy the DataSync agent as a virtual machine in the same local CG network as your source storage. This approach minimizes network overhead associated with transferring data using network protocols such as Network File System (NFS) and Server Message Block (SMB), or when accessing your self-managed object storage using the Amazon S3 API. Below we will detail the process to implement DataSync via Private VPC Endpoint, and can be visualized with the diagram shown next.
<br>

<img src="/docs/img/datasync/vpce.png" width="800"><br>

**PART 1 - Configuring DataSync with VPC Endpoint**<br>
- **Start: Deploy Agent**<br>
  - Please select DataSync from the AWS Services bar as seen below to begin.<br>
  <img src="/docs/img/datasync/ds_search.png" width="600">

  - Next, select the type of transfer either `Between AWS Storage Services` or `Between on-Prem and AWS Storage Services` and click **Get Started**. If you are migrating data between on-prem and AWS, at this point, please [Navigate to Part 2](#PART-2-Creating-a-DataSync-Agent-On-Premesis) to continue.<br>
  <img src="/docs/img/datasync/get_started.png" width="600">

- **Step 1: Initial DataSync Setup**<br>
  - Choose the `VPC` and `subnet` where you want to set up the DataSync private IP addresses. The default VPC and Subnets can be used, as long as they do not contain any direct Internet access through an IGW or the likes. If a new VPC is needed , please see the following: [VPC Runbook](https://github.com/open-itg/aws_runbooks/blob/master/vpc/RUNBOOK.md)<br>
  - Make sure to allow outbound traffic from the agent to the VPC endpoint by using ports 443, 1024–1064. This might need to be added to the CXDC Firewalls and VPC Security Groups.

- **Step 2: Create VPC Endpoint**<br>
  - Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/, and choose Endpoints from the navigation pane at left.  
  - Choose Create Endpoint.
    - For Service category, choose AWS service. 
    - For Service Name, choose DataSync in your AWS Region (for example, com.amazonaws.us-east-1.datasync).
    - Then choose the VPC and security group that you chose in steps 1 and 3. 
    - Make sure that you `clear` the Enable Private DNS Name check box.

- **Step 3: Continuation of DataSync Setup**<br>
  - When your new VPC endpoint becomes available, make sure that the network configuration for your self-managed environment allows agent activation.
  - `Activate the Agent`. If you have a computer that can route to the agent by using port 80 and that can access the DataSync console, open the console and choose Create Agent. In the service endpoint section, choose VPC endpoints using AWS PrivateLink. Choose the `VPC endpoint` created earlier, the `subnet` , and the `security group`. Enter the `agent's IP address`.
  - Choose `Get Key` and choose Create agent. Your new agent now appears on the Agents tab of the DataSync console. The green VPC Endpoint banner indicates that all tasks performed with this agent use private endpoints, without crossing the public internet.
  - Create your task by configuring a `source` and a `destination` for your data transfer.
  - Make sure that your agent can reach the `four elastic network interfaces` and `related IP addresses` that your task creates. To find these IP addresses, open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/, and choose Network Interfaces on the dashboard. Enter the task ID into the search filter to see the four elastic network interfaces for the task. These are the elastic network interfaces used by your VPC endpoint.
  - The DataSync Task can now run, and setup is complete.<br>

**PART 2 - Creating a DataSync Agent On-Premesis**<br>
This section assumes the agent is being deployed to VMWare, which is currently CG's standard deployment infrastructure for on-prem virtual machines.
 - Open the AWS DataSync console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/datasync/.
 - On the Create agent page in the console, choose `Download image` in the Deploy agent section. Doing this downloads the agent and deploys it in your VMware ESXi hypervisor. The agent is available as a VM. 
 - If you have previously activated an agent in this AWS Region and want to use that agent, choose that agent and choose `Create agent`. The Configure a source location page appears.
  - Power on your hypervisor, log in to your new VM, and get the IP address of the agent. You need this IP address to `activate the agent`.
  - Now please return to `Part 1`, `Step 1` above to continue.
