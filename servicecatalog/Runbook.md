## Overview
AWS Service Catalog allows organizations to create and manage catalogs of IT services that are approved for use on AWS. These IT services can include everything from virtual machine images, servers, software, and databases to complete multi-tier application architectures. AWS Service Catalog allows you to centrally manage deployed IT services and your applications, resources, and metadata. This helps you achieve consistent governance and meet your compliance requirements, while enabling users to quickly deploy only the approved IT services they need. With AWS Service Catalog AppRegistry, organizations can understand the application context of their AWS resources. You can define and manage your applications and their metadata, to keep track of cost, performance, security, compliance and operational status at the application level.

### Features:
 - Ensure compliance with corporate standards
 - Help employees quickly find and deploy approved IT services
 - Centrally manage IT service lifecycle
 - Connect with ITSM/ITOM software
 - Manage all of your application information on AWS

## Preventative Controls

### 1. Service Catalog utilizes Private VPC Endpoint to prevent public access
AWS Service Catalog does currently support Private VPC Endpoints for accessing the service, and as such allows the Service Catalog product to meet CG's stringent Public Access control requirements.

|[CS0012300](https://capitalgroup.service-now.com/cg_grc?sys_id=80df48c01bac20506a50beef034bcb47&table=sn_compliance_policy_statement&id=cg_grc_action_item_details&view=sp)|Cloud products and services must be deployed on private subnets and public access must be disabled for these services.|
<br>

**Why?**<br>
Service Catalog is a service that allows administrators to allow pre-screened services for use, We need to make sure that this traffic is not transmitted directly over the public Internet in adherence to CG's Cloud Standards.
<br>

**How?**<br>
CG standards mandate that no cloud service should be accessible over the Internet or publicly accessible cloud provider networks. CG uses Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) to host our AWS resources and we need to establish a private connection between your VPC and AWS Config. This connection can be used to communicate with AWS Config from the VPC without going through the public internet.

Interface VPC endpoints are powered by AWS PrivateLink, an AWS technology that enables private communication between AWS services using an elastic network interface with private IP addresses. To connect a VPC to AWS Config, you define an interface VPC endpoint for AWS Config. This type of endpoint enables you to connect your VPC to AWS services. The endpoint provides reliable, scalable connectivity to AWS Config without requiring an internet gateway, network address translation (NAT) instance, or VPN connection. Below are the steps needed to deploy an Interface Endpoint for AWS Config:

**Creation of Interface VPC Endpoint**
  1. Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/, and choose Endpoints from the navigation pane at left.
  2. Choose Create Endpoint.
     - For Service category, choose AWS service. 
     - For Service Name, choose Config in your AWS Region (for example, `com.amazonaws.us-east-1.servicecatalog`).
     - Then choose the VPC, if it does not already exist follow this [link](https://github.com/open-itg/aws_runbooks/blob/master/vpc/RUNBOOK.md) for instructions on how to create a new VPC. 
     - Select a security group for AWS Config, if the default security group will not suffice then follow this [link](https://github.com/open-itg/aws_runbooks/blob/master/vpc/RUNBOOK.md) for instructions on how to create a new Security Group. 
     - Make sure that you `Enable` the Enable Private DNS Name check box.
     - Now add the appropriate CG standard tags.
  4. Click `Create Endpoint` to complete the process.
