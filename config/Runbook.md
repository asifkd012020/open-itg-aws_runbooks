## Overview
AWS Config provides a detailed view of the configuration of AWS resources in your AWS account. This includes how the resources are related to one another and how they were configured in the past so that you can see how the configurations and relationships change over time.

An AWS resource is an entity you can work with in AWS, such as an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance, an Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume, a security group, or an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). For a complete list of AWS resources supported by AWS Config.

**With AWS Config, you can do the following:**
 - Evaluate your AWS resource configurations for desired settings.
 - Get a snapshot of the current configurations of the supported resources that are associated with your AWS account.
 - Retrieve configurations of one or more resources that exist in your account.
 - Retrieve historical configurations of one or more resources.
 - Receive a notification whenever a resource is created, modified, or deleted.
 - View relationships between resources. For example, you might want to find all resources that use a particular security group.

### 1. Config Utilizes VPC Endpoints to Prevent Public Access
AWS Config does currently support VPC Endpoints for gathering information from supported services, and as such allows the Config service to meet CG's stringent Public Access control requirements.
<br>

**NIST CSF:** <br>

|NIST Subcategory Control|Description|
|-----------|------------------------|
|PR.PT-4|Communications and control networks are protected|
|PR.PT-5|Mechanisms (e.g., failsafe, load balancing, hot swap) are implemented to achieve resilience requirements in normal and adverse situations|
|PR.AC-3|Remote access is managed|
|PR.AC-5|Network integrity is protected (e.g., network segregation, network segmentation)|
<br>

**Capital Group:** <br>

|Control Statement|Description|
|------|----------------------|
|6|Any AWS service used by CG should not be directly available to the Internet and the default route is always the CG gateway.|
|7|Use of AWS IAM accounts are restricted to CG networks.|
<br>

**Why?**<br>
Config is a service that allows for the scanning and reporting on AWS Services and their usage. Due to the possibility of this either containing sensitive data or the configuration information itself being sensitive, We need to make sure that this traffic is not transmitted directly over the public Internet in adherence to CG's Cloud Standards.
<br>

**How?**<br>
CG standards mandate that no cloud service should be accessible over the Internet or publicly accessible cloud provider networks. CG uses Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) to host our AWS resources and we need to establish a private connection between your VPC and AWS Config. This connection can be used to communicate with AWS Config from the VPC without going through the public internet.

Interface VPC endpoints are powered by AWS PrivateLink, an AWS technology that enables private communication between AWS services using an elastic network interface with private IP addresses. To connect a VPC to AWS Config, you define an interface VPC endpoint for AWS Config. This type of endpoint enables you to connect your VPC to AWS services. The endpoint provides reliable, scalable connectivity to AWS Config without requiring an internet gateway, network address translation (NAT) instance, or VPN connection. Below are the steps needed to deploy an Interface Endpoint for AWS Config:

**Creation of Interface VPC Endpoint**
  1. Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/, and choose Endpoints from the navigation pane at left.
  2. Choose Create Endpoint.
     - For Service category, choose AWS service. 
     - For Service Name, choose Config in your AWS Region (for example, `com.amazonaws.us-east-1.config`).
     - Then choose the VPC, if it does not already exist follow this [link](https://github.com/open-itg/aws_runbooks/blob/master/vpc/RUNBOOK.md) for instructions on how to create a new VPC. 
     - Select a security group for AWS Config, if the default security group will not suffice then follow this [link](https://github.com/open-itg/aws_runbooks/blob/master/vpc/RUNBOOK.md) for instructions on how to create a new Security Group. 
     - Make sure that you `Enable` the Enable Private DNS Name check box.
     - Now add the appropriate CG standard tags.
  4. Click `Create Endpoint` to complete the process.

### 2. Config leverages IAM Users and Roles Enforce Least Priviledge
`This Section will be updated soon.`

### 3. Config connections are protected with TLS 1.2
`This Section will be updated soon.`

### 4. Config data is encrypted using CG managed KMS Keys
`This Section will be updated soon.`

### 5. Config is enabled only for specific US Regions

 - `us-west-1, us-west-2, us-east-1, us-east-2`<br>
 - `This Section will be updated soon.`

### 6. Config cannot be disabled by Member Account Owners
`This Section will be updated soon.`

### 7. Config is automatically enabled at the member account level
`This Section will be updated soon.`
### 8. Restricting the deletion of config-configuration recorder
Here it will restrict the stopping or deletion of configuration recorder and delivery channel.The implementation done through the following policy
```
{
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Action": [
        "config:DeleteConfigurationRecorder",
        "config:DeleteDeliveryChannel",
        "config:StopConfigurationRecorder"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "*"
      ]
    }
```    
<br><br>

## Capital Group Glossory 
**Data** - Digital pieces of information stored or transmitted for use with an information system from which understandable information is derived. Items that could be considered to be data are: Source code, meta-data, build artifacts, information input and output.  
 
**Information System** - An organized assembly of resources and procedures for the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information. All systems, platforms, compute instances including and not limited to physical and virtual client endpoints, physical and virtual servers, software containers, databases, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, network devices, applications (internal and external), Serverless computing instances (i.e. AWS Lambda), vendor provided appliances, and third-party platforms, connected to the Capital Group network or used by Capital Group users or customers.

**Log** - a record of the events occurring within information systems and networks. Logs are composed of log entries; each entry contains information related to a specific event that has occurred within a system or network.

**Information** - communication or representation of knowledge such as facts, data, or opinions in any medium or form, including textual, numerical, graphic, cartographic, narrative, or audiovisual. 

**Cloud computing** - A model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

**Vulnerability**  - Weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat source. Note: The term weakness is synonymous for deficiency. Weakness may result in security and/or privacy risks.
