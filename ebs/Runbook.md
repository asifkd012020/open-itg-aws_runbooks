## Overview
Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides block level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances. EBS volumes behave like raw, unformatted block devices. You can mount these volumes as devices on your instances. EBS volumes that are attached to an instance are exposed as storage volumes that persist independently from the life of the instance. You can create a file system on top of these volumes, or use them in any way you would use a block device (such as a hard drive). You can dynamically change the configuration of a volume attached to an instance.

AWS recommends Amazon EBS for data that must be quickly accessible and requires long-term persistence. EBS volumes are particularly well-suited for use as the primary storage for file systems, databases, or for any applications that require fine granular updates and access to raw, unformatted, block-level storage. Amazon EBS is well suited to both database-style applications that rely on random reads and writes, and to throughput-intensive applications that perform long, continuous reads and writes.

## Preventative Controls

### 1. EBS is Encrypted using CG Managed KMS Keys
Encryption operations for EBS storage occurs on the servers that host EC2 instances, ensuring the security of both data-at-rest and data-in-transit between an instance and its attached EBS storage. Due to this fact, the encryption of EBS storage is detailed in the EC2 Runbook linked below:

<br>

### 2. EBS Snapshots are Encrypted using CG Managed KMS Keys
CG's Cloud Security standards require that we ensure that the AWS EBS volume snapshots that hold sensitive, critical or any other data are encrypted to fulfill compliance requirements for data-at-rest encryption. The EBS snapshot data encryption and decryption is handled transparently once it has been enabled. Details on EBS Snapshot encryption is detailed in the EC2 Runbook linked below:

### 3. EBS Snapshot permissions are set to Private

**Capital Group Controls:**

|Control Statement|Description|
|------|----------------------|
|[CS0012300](https://capitalgroup.service-now.com/cg_grc?sys_id=80df48c01bac20506a50beef034bcb47&table=sn_compliance_policy_statement&id=cg_grc_action_item_details&view=sp)|Cloud products and services must be deployed on private subnets and public access must be disabled for these services.|

**Why?**

As mentioned previously, CG requires that all data in the cloud be secured against public accessibility. To ensure snapshots are correctly secured we don't just rely on the VPC controls, but need to also mark the snapshot as `Private`.  This is part of a defence in depth strategy, helping to further protect against misconfiguration.

**How?**

To ensure that your EBS snapshots have been securely set to Private, please follow the steps below:
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to **EC2 dashboard** at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.
3. In the left navigation panel, under `ELASTIC BLOCK STORE` section, choose `Snapshots`.
4. Select the volume snapshot that you want to modify.
5. Select `Permissions tab` from the dashboard bottom panel and check the snapshot access permissions. If the selected EBS volume snapshot is publicly accessible, the EC2 dashboard will display the following `status: "This snapshot is currently Private."`. Otherwise it will show as `Public`. If the snapshot is listed as public, one should click the `edit` button and change to permission to Private as soon as possible.

6. Repeat steps no. 4 and 5 to verify the access permissions are `private` for other EBS volume snapshots available in the current region.
7. Change the AWS region from the navigation bar and repeat the audit process for the EBS snapshots in other regions as needed.

### 4. EBS Snapshots will only be shared between CG accounts

|Control Statement|Description|
|------|----------------------|
|[CS0012300](https://capitalgroup.service-now.com/cg_grc?sys_id=80df48c01bac20506a50beef034bcb47&table=sn_compliance_policy_statement&id=cg_grc_action_item_details&view=sp)|Cloud products and services must be deployed on private subnets and public access must be disabled for these services.|

**Why?**

CG's public access requirements for cloud state that resources and data in the cloud should not be shared and as such EBS volumes should only be shared with and within CG accounts. The reason is when you give another AWS account permission to both copy the snapshot and create a volume from it. Most of the time your AWS EBS snapshots will contain mirrors of your applications (including their data), therefore sharing your snapshots allows access to this data.

**How?**

>**Important:**
*When you share a snapshot, you are giving others access to all of the data on the snapshot. Share snapshots only with accounts that you trust with all of your snapshot data.*

### 1. Before you share a EBS snapshot
The following considerations apply to sharing snapshots:

 - Snapshots are constrained to the Region in which they were created. To share a snapshot with another Region, copy the snapshot to that Region and then share the copy.
 - You can't share snapshots that are encrypted with the default AWS managed key. You can only share snapshots that are encrypted with a customer managed key. This shouldnt be an issue as CG Managed Keys are required.
- When you share an encrypted snapshot, you must also share the customer managed key used to encrypt the snapshot. This will be covered in the [KMS Runbook](https://github.com/open-itg/aws_runbooks/blob/master/kms/Runbook.md).

### 2. Sharing an EBS snapshot
Below is the series of steps needed to share an EBS Snapshot:
1. Open the Amazon `EC2 console` at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.
2. Choose `Snapshots` in the navigation pane.
3. Select the snapshot and then choose Actions, Modify Permissions.
4. To share the snapshot with one or more AWS accounts
    - Choose `Private`
    - Enter the `AWS account ID` *(without hyphens)* in AWS Account Number, and choose `Add Permission`. 
    - Repeat for any additional AWS accounts.
5. Choose `Save`.
