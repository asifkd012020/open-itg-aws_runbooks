## Overview
AWS Backup is a fully managed backup service that makes it easy to centralize and automate the backup of data across AWS services in the cloud and on premises. Using AWS Backup, you can configure backup policies and monitor backup activity for your AWS resources in one place. AWS Backup automates and consolidates backup tasks that were previously performed service-by-service, and removes the need to create custom scripts and manual processes. With just a few clicks on the AWS Backup console, you can create backup policies that automate backup schedules and retention management.

AWS Backup does not support all AWS services at this time, but does support some of the more widely used services such as: EFS, DynamoDB, EC2, EBS, Aurora and RDS most of which CG has in wide use.

AWS Backup provides the following features and capabilities out the box:<br>

- Centralized Backup Management
- Cross-Account Management
- Cross-Region Backup
- Policy-Based Backup
- Tag-Based Backup
- Backup Access Policies
- Backup Activity Monitoring

Below is an example organizational level deployment of AWS backup:<br>

**NOTE:** <br>
>`AWS Backup is an AWS Managed service offering, the underlying Infrastructure including Network and Compute resources are all managed by AWS as explained in the Shared Responsibility Model. Due to this fact, CG's standard public access controls cannot be applied and the application of appropriate controls to keep the service from external or public accessibility falls on AWS. The IAM and Encryption controls however remain CG's responsibility and are listed in the sections below.`

## Capital Group Glossory 
**Data** - Digital pieces of information stored or transmitted for use with an information system from which understandable information is derived. Items that could be considered to be data are: Source code, meta-data, build artifacts, information input and output.  
 
**Information System** - An organized assembly of resources and procedures for the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information. All systems, platforms, compute instances including and not limited to physical and virtual client endpoints, physical and virtual servers, software containers, databases, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, network devices, applications (internal and external), Serverless computing instances (i.e. AWS Lambda), vendor provided appliances, and third-party platforms, connected to the Capital Group network or used by Capital Group users or customers.

**Log** - a record of the events occurring within information systems and networks. Logs are composed of log entries; each entry contains information related to a specific event that has occurred within a system or network.

**Information** - communication or representation of knowledge such as facts, data, or opinions in any medium or form, including textual, numerical, graphic, cartographic, narrative, or audiovisual. 

**Cloud computing** - A model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

**Vulnerability**  - Weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat source. Note: The term weakness is synonymous for deficiency. Weakness may result in security and/or privacy risks.
