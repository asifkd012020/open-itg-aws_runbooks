## Overview
AWS Backup is a fully managed backup service that makes it easy to centralize and automate the backup of data across AWS services in the cloud and on premises. Using AWS Backup, you can configure backup policies and monitor backup activity for your AWS resources in one place. AWS Backup automates and consolidates backup tasks that were previously performed service-by-service, and removes the need to create custom scripts and manual processes. With just a few clicks on the AWS Backup console, you can create backup policies that automate backup schedules and retention management.

AWS Backup does not support all AWS services at this time, but does support some of the more widely used services such as: EFS, DynamoDB, EC2, EBS, Aurora and RDS most of which CG has in wide use.

AWS Backup provides the following features and capabilities out the box:<br>

- Centralized Backup Management
- Cross-Account Management
- Cross-Region Backup
- Policy-Based Backup
- Tag-Based Backup
- Backup Access Policies
- Backup Activity Monitoring
