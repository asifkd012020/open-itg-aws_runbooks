## Overview
AWS AppSync is a fully managed service that makes it easy to develop GraphQL APIs by handling the heavy lifting of securely connecting to data sources like AWS DynamoDB, Lambda, and more. Adding caches to improve performance, subscriptions to support real-time updates, and client-side data stores that keep off-line clients in sync are just as easy. Once deployed, AWS AppSync automatically scales your GraphQL API execution engine up and down to meet API request volumes.

### **Benefits**
 - Simple & Secure data access
 - Built-in real-time & offline capabilities
 - No servers to manage

## Preventative Controls

### 1. Restrict Access to Deny Regions Outside US region
 *Policy resticts the access to Deny any resources outside of US Region*

## Service Denial Explanation
Three of the Core Tenets of our migration to and use of cloud technologies are as follows: 
 1. No public accessibility or deployment on public facing networks.
 2. Encryption of all data in the cloud at all times and using CG Managed keys.
 3. Strict Identity & Access controls to provide least priviledge access to the service.

 Although the AppSync service does enable us to adhere to tenets 2 and 3, it fails to meet the public access requirements. There are ways to mitigate the effects of this public access, but the service is still hosted on a public IP address and not within the bounds of CG's private IP space as required per the following GRC Control:
  - [CS0012300 - Cloud products and services must be deployed on private subnets and public access must be disabled for these services.](https://capitalgroup.service-now.com/cg_grc?sys_id=80df48c01bac20506a50beef034bcb47&table=sn_compliance_policy_statement&id=cg_grc_action_item_details&view=sp)

Through discussions with AWS under NDA, we have learned that deploying AppSync to a Private VPC is on the product roadmap for delivery sometime in the next year (April 2022). Once this feature is generally available, we will schedule a review of the service at that time.

## Capital Group Glossory 
**Data** - Digital pieces of information stored or transmitted for use with an information system from which understandable information is derived. Items that could be considered to be data are: Source code, meta-data, build artifacts, information input and output.  
 
**Information System** - An organized assembly of resources and procedures for the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information. All systems, platforms, compute instances including and not limited to physical and virtual client endpoints, physical and virtual servers, software containers, databases, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, network devices, applications (internal and external), Serverless computing instances (i.e. AWS Lambda), vendor provided appliances, and third-party platforms, connected to the Capital Group network or used by Capital Group users or customers.

**Log** - a record of the events occurring within information systems and networks. Logs are composed of log entries; each entry contains information related to a specific event that has occurred within a system or network.

**Information** - communication or representation of knowledge such as facts, data, or opinions in any medium or form, including textual, numerical, graphic, cartographic, narrative, or audiovisual. 

**Cloud computing** - A model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

**Vulnerability**  - Weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat source. Note: The term weakness is synonymous for deficiency. Weakness may result in security and/or privacy risks.
