## Overview
Elastic Load Balancing automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses, Lambda functions, and virtual appliances. It can handle the varying load of your application traffic in a single Availability Zone or across multiple Availability Zones. Elastic Load Balancing offers four types of load balancers that all feature the high availability, automatic scaling, and robust security necessary to make your applications fault tolerant.

This Runbook's focus is specifically related to the Application Load Balancer (ALB) as there will be other runbooks focusing on Network Load Balancer (NLB) and Gateway Load Balancer (GLB). Application Load Balancer is best suited for load balancing of HTTP and HTTPS traffic and provides advanced request routing targeted at the delivery of modern application architectures, including microservices and containers. Application Load Balancer routes traffic to targets within Amazon VPC based on the content of the request.

**Below is a reference diagram of an ALB deployment:**

**NOTE:** This document currently only pertains to the "Amazon Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)" service and not the "Classic Load Balancer" service offering as it is outdated.

The following NIST Controls and Subcategories are not applicable to this service:

## Preventative Controls
<img src="/docs/img/Prevent.png" width="50">

### 1. ALB Deployed in Private VPC and set to Internal
Since our initial migration of services to the cloud, CG has taken the stance that by default no service should exposed to the public internet. 

**Why?**<br>
Utilizing a Private VPC and setting an ALB to only be accessible by internal resources allows an application to be only accessible by CG owned resources and does not expose the endpoint to the public Internet.  There should always be a diliniation between Private CG services and Public Facing CG services, Private VPC allows for this.

**How?**<br>
To adhere to the requirement that all cloud resources be internaly accessible only, all ALB resources should be built within a **Private VPC** and the deployment 'Scheme' be set to **'Internal'** as this will assign a private IP address to the load-balancer. 


*Private VPC Example:*

<br>

### 2. ALB Deployed with appropriate Security Groups
One of the core tenets of Information Security is least priviledge, and one tool to enforce least priviledge is a Security Group.   

**Why?**<br>
A security group is a set of firewall rules that can be applied to the service, limiting the open ports and restricting access to specific IP ranges.  As with an on-premesis firewall, Security Groups can be an effective tool in a defense in depth strategy to protect resources and services from unauthorized access.

**How?**<br>
Security Groups should be setup to limit access to the ALB for only hosts that truly require access to the service and deny access to all other hosts.  The Default VPC security group should not be used as it is overly permissive and may provide unintended access. CG has provided a specific base security group in each new AWS account that provides a good option as a default starting point and should be named **'cg-alb-base-sg'**.

### 3. Enforce HTTPS and TLS 1.2 using cert signed by CG CA
Another of the core CG controls that has been required from day one, is that of Encryption of all cloud resources at rest and in transit. To this end for ALB connections, its required to utilize HTTPS to provide encryption of all data in transit.  CG also requires that [TLS 1.2 (Transport Layer Security)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/transport-layer-security-tls/) or later be used as the encryption mechanism for HTTPS connections. 

**Why?**<br>
TLS encryption can help protect web applications from data breaches and other attacks. Additionally, TLS-protected HTTPS is quickly becoming a standard practice for websites. For example, the Google Chrome browser is cracking down on non-HTTPS sites, and everyday Internet users are starting to become more wary of websites that do not feature the HTTPS padlock icon.  At CG we want users to become very wary of sites that are not correctly signed as these may well be the vector by which a malicious actor gains a access into our network.

**How?**<br>
There are three main components to what the TLS protocol accomplishes: Encryption, Authentication, and Integrity.

- Encryption: hides the data being transferred from third parties.
- Authentication: ensures that the parties exchanging information are who they claim to be.
- Integrity: verifies that the data has not been forged or tampered with.

Below are the steps that need to be taken to enable HTTPS with TLS 1.2 when creating a new ALB in AWS:

 *Step 1 - Enable HTTPS:*

<img src="/docs/img/alb/HTTPS.png" width="800">

*Step 2 - Certificate Selection*

When HTTPS has been enabled, one will need to select a certificate that will be used for the HTTPS connections and a CG signed certificate should be used to front these connections via AWS ACM integration.

This can either be an ACM existing certificate uploaded to the Account by the Security Engineering team via Venafi or the Nomos tool, or manually uploaded by importing the certificate by pasting in the certificate details in the Configure Security Settings step, as seen in the examples below:

*Existing Certificate Example:*

<img src="/docs/img/alb/ACM1.png" width="800">
<br>

*Import Certificate Example:*

<img src="/docs/img/alb/ACM2.png" width="800">
<br>

*Step 3 - Enable TLS 1.2*

When building a new ALB, once HTTPS has been selected and Certificate uploaded, one should then select **'ELBSecurityPolicy-FS-1-2-Res-2020-10'** or newer under the Configure Security Settings step, just after Certificate Selection.

**Information System** - An organized assembly of resources and procedures for the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information. All systems, platforms, compute instances including and not limited to physical and virtual client endpoints, physical and virtual servers, software containers, databases, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, network devices, applications (internal and external), Serverless computing instances (i.e. AWS Lambda), vendor provided appliances, and third-party platforms, connected to the Capital Group network or used by Capital Group users or customers.

**Log** - a record of the events occurring within information systems and networks. Logs are composed of log entries; each entry contains information related to a specific event that has occurred within a system or network.

**Information** - communication or representation of knowledge such as facts, data, or opinions in any medium or form, including textual, numerical, graphic, cartographic, narrative, or audiovisual. 

**Cloud computing** - A model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

**Vulnerability**  - Weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat source. Note: The term weakness is synonymous for deficiency. Weakness may result in security and/or privacy risks.
