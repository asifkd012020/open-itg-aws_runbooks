## Overview
Azure Kubernetes Service(AKS) is a managed Kubernetes offering in Microsoft Azure which simplifies deployment & management of the cluster. 
Kubernetes control plane is managed by Azure, you only manage and maintain the agent nodes.  

The following playbook will outline what the Azure best practices are and how to implement these best practices when provisioning an AKS Cluster. 


## Preventative Controls
<img src="/docs/img/Prevent.png" width="50">

### 1. AKS deployed in Private VNET with no public access
AKS control plane can be configured to private and provisioned within a CG Virtual Network.  This allows network traffic between Control Plane and node pools to be on a private network only.  

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/private-clusters
Cloud9 as a service runs on top of EC2 instances as its backend, and this allows us to enforce public access controls as per the current CG cloud standards. This section details the process of deploying Cloud9 on no-ingress EC2 instances in a private VPC on a CG internal subnet. 

**NIST CSF:** <br>


<br>

**Capital Group:** <br>

|Control Statement|Description|
|------|----------------------|
|6|Any AWS service used by CG should not be directly available to the Internet and the default route is always the CG gateway.|
|7|Use of AWS IAM accounts are restricted to CG networks.|
<br>

**Why?**<br>
When creating a new cluster, Azure AKS creates an endpoint for the managed Kubernetes API server used to communicate with the cluster (using kubernetes management tools such as kubectl). By default, this API server endpoint is public to the internet, and access to the API server is secured using a combination of Azure AD and Kubernetes Role Based Access Control

By default Azure AKS also provisions a public load balancer for egress traffic.  
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/egress-outboundtype 
<br>

**How?**<br>
Private access can be enabled to the Kubernetes API server so that all communication between node pools and the API server stays within the VNet. If you only need to manage the Kubernetes cluster from within a VNet, a private cluster API endpoint can be leveraged, which prevents traffic from traversing the open internet. 


**Enabling Private Cluster**<br>
In this section instructions are for Azure AKS provisioning with terraform for a private cluster api endpoint.<br><br>
   **Step 1:** Enable Private Cluster under Network Settings. This will set the kubernetes api endpoint private (https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/kubernetes_cluster#private_cluster_enabled) <br> 
   ```
   private_cluster_enabled=true
   ```
   **Step 2:** Enable User Defined Routing. This will prevent Azure AKS from provisioning a public load balancer for egress. (https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/kubernetes_cluster#outbound_type) <br>
   ```
   outbound_type=userDefinedRouting
   ```


### 2. Data is protected using a CG Managed Key 

**NIST CSF:** <br>

<br>

**Capital Group:** <br>

Capital Group:
|Control Statement|Description|
|------|----------------------|
|1|All Data-at-rest must be encrypted and use a CG BYOK encryption key.|
|2|Keys storied in a Key Management System (KMS) should be created by Capital Group's hardware security module (HSM) and are a minimum of AES-256.|
<br>

**Why?**<br>
Data should be protected in-transit between the customer and Azure, as well as within Azure Services using NIST-approved encryption mechanism.

**How?**<br>

Master Servers in the Control Plane have EBS-encrypted volumes with AWS-managed KMS keys. **This key cannot be changed, and BYOK is not possible on EKS Master Servers**.  
Encryption of Worker node volumes is managed by customers, and therefore can use customer-managed KMS keys.  
The Amazon EKS-optimized AMI is not encrypted by default; however, encryption can be accomplished through AMI customization just like with other EC2 instances and images.  
When creating Kubernetes storage classes within your cluster, you are available to specify that the EBS storage class is encrypted, and you are able to set a defined storage class as a default. Kubernetes storage classes on EBS are encrypted with AWS-managed or customer-managed KMS keys.  
Enable Envelope Encryption for Secrets in EKS. This allows you to encrypt your secrets with a customer-managed key, inside of the encrypted EBS volume that uses the AWS-managed key.



### 3. AKS enforce least privilege for access to API server & nodes 
**Why?**<br>
One of the most important way to secure your cluster is to secure access to the Kubernetes API server. 

**How?**<br>
To control access to the API server, integrate Kubernetes RBAC with Azure Active Directory(Azure AD)

**Enabling Azure AD Integration for RBAC**<br>
In this section instructions are for Azure AKS integration with Azure Active Directory with terraform.<br><br>
   **Step 1:** Enable RBAC with Azure Active Directory (https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/kubernetes_cluster#azure_active_directory) <br> 

   ```
  role_based_access_control {
    enabled = true
    azure_active_directory {
      managed = true
      admin_group_object_ids = data.azuread_groups.aks_admin_group.object_ids
    }
  }
   ```

### 4. AKS utilizes managed identities to enforce least priviledge

`This Section will be updated soon.`

### 5. AKS connections are protected with TLS 1.2

**NIST CSF:** <br>

<br>

**Capital Group:** <br>

Capital Group:
|Control Statement|Description|
|------|----------------------|
|1|All Data-in-transit must be encrypted using certificates using CG Certificate Authority.|

<br>

**Why?**<br>
Data should be protected in-transit between the customer and Azure, as well as within Azure Services using NIST-approved encryption mechanism.

**How?**<br>
Communication with the Azure AKS API endpoint enforces HTTPS and Kubernetes default management communications on AKS are TLS encrypted between kubectl, kubelet, AWS IAM Auth and the kubernetes cluster API.  




## Detective Controls

**Cloud computing** - A model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

**Vulnerability**  - Weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat source. Note: The term weakness is synonymous for deficiency. Weakness may result in security and/or privacy risks.
