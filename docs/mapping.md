# GRC Mapping Files
Information related to the creation, modification and use of the GRC mapping files.

## What is GRC?
Our new GRC (Global Risk and Compliance) module in ServiceNow has allowed for a better place for storing the Cloud security controls that all deployments need to adhere to. Previously all the control statements were stored in Confluence and were both hard to find and not specifically talored to include Cloud based deployments.  The new GRC platform allows for easier lookup of controls and where they should be applied.

## What are GRC Mapping Files?
We now know that our GRC tool allows for a better place to store and lookup our controls, but how do we ensure we adhere to them correctly across all the Cloud resources we have out there?  This is where the GRC mapping files come into play. Each service, in each cloud provider should have a runbook associated with it. The runbooks give exaples of how CG expects a specific service to be built, including which detective and preventative controls should be present. 

The GRC mapping files, as with the runbooks should be present for each service that a cloud provider offers and allows a platform that teams can utilize to show how they are meeting the control objectives set out in the runbook for the specific service as seen in the diagram below.
