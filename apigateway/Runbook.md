## Overview
One of the biggest trends in application development today is the use of APIs to power the backend technologies supporting a product. Increasingly, the way mobile, IoT, web applications, or internal services talk to each other and to application frontends is using some API interface.

Alongside this trend of building API-powered applications is the move to a microservices application design pattern. A larger application is represented by many smaller application components, also typically communicating via API. The growth of APIs and microservices being used together is driven across all sorts of companies, from startups up through enterprises. The number of tools required to manage APIs at scale, securely, and with minimal operational overhead is growing as well.

**NOTE:** This document currently only pertains to *"Amazon API Gateway deployed using Private Endpoints"* and not *"Edge-Optimized API Gateway"* as these are deployed in a publically accessible model and do not adhere to CG's Cloud Security Standards.

The following NIST Controls and Subcategories are not applicable to this service:  

The following Capital Group control statements are not applicable to this service:

## Preventative Controls

### 1. API Gateway Deployed with Private Endpoints
When API gateway was originally released, the only deployment option was to deploy the API Gateway publically and fronted with CloudFront.  This deployment model does not adhere to the CG cloud security standards, specifically that all cloud resources be deployed privately with a CG internal IP address range.  Fortunatly AWS has an API Gateway offering that since 2017, has allowed one to deploy on a private VPC using Private Endpoints.  
<br>

**Below is a reference diagram of an API Gateway Private Endpoints deployment:**

<br>

**NIST CSF:** <br>

|NIST Subcategory Control|Description|
|-----------|------------------------|
|PR.PT-4|Communications and control networks are protected|
|PR.PT-5|Mechanisms (e.g., failsafe, load balancing, hot swap) are implemented to achieve resilience requirements in normal and adverse situations|
|PR.AC-3|Remote access is managed|
|PR.AC-5|Network integrity is protected (e.g., network segregation, network segmentation)|
<br>

**Capital Group:** <br>

|Control Statement|Description|
|------|----------------------|
|6|Any AWS service used by CG should not be directly available to the Internet and the default route is always the CG gateway.|
|7|Use of AWS IAM accounts are restricted to CG networks.|
<br>

**Why?**<br>
This deployment model allows the API Gateway to be only accessible by other services within the VPC and any internal services allowed through the associated Security Groups, which will be detailed in [the next section](#2-API-Gateway-Deployed-with-appropriate-Security-Groups).  This allows for the deployment to meet the stict CG public access policy for all cloud deployments.
<br>

**How?**<br>
Deploying an API Gateway using private Endpoints can be done by following four steps as below:

1. Creation of a new VPC <br>

If there is currently no private VPC, one will need to be created with at least one subnet and needs to have DNS resolution enabled as seen below.

<img src="/docs/img/apigw/vpc_ex.png" width="800"> 
<br>

2. Creation of a VPC Endpoint

Search Endpoint Servicesw in the AWS search bar, click on Endpoint services which should be a sub-category of VPC Services. Now click on **Create Endpoint** as seen in the screenshot below.
<br>
<img src="/docs/img/apigw/create_endpoint.png" width="800"> 
<br>

Now in the VPC Endpoint configuration use the following settings to initialize your Endpoint.
 - **Service Category:** "AWS Services"
 - **Service Name:** "com.amazonaws.{AWS region}.execute-api"
 - **VPC:** "Select the [VPC](https://github.com/open-itg/aws_runbooks/blob/master/vpc/RUNBOOK.md) in which the endpoint will reside."
 - **Enable Private DNS:** "Enabled"

<br>

The next section deals with Security Group creation and assignment.
<br>

3. Creation and attachment of a Security Group 

Once we have the initial configuration of the Endpoint, we now need to secure it with assignment of a Security Group. One can use a default Security Group, but it is a better option to create a security group for our service to limit the access to only allow CG IP's and port 443 (HTTPS) as below.

We first need to click on create security group, after the appropriate VPC has been selected.

<img src="/docs/img/apigw/sg_create.png" width="800"> 

Now we need to create a new security group with the following baseline settings, although the security group can be created with even more restricted access if company wide access is not needed.

- **Security Group Name:** "APIGWSG" or something similar.
- **Description:** "API Gateway Access for HTTPS traffic" or similar.
- **VPC:** Select the VPC that will be used for the Endpoint and API GW.

## Capital Group Glossory 
**Data** - Digital pieces of information stored or transmitted for use with an information system from which understandable information is derived. Items that could be considered to be data are: Source code, meta-data, build artifacts, information input and output.  
 
**Information System** - An organized assembly of resources and procedures for the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information. All systems, platforms, compute instances including and not limited to physical and virtual client endpoints, physical and virtual servers, software containers, databases, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, network devices, applications (internal and external), Serverless computing instances (i.e. AWS Lambda), vendor provided appliances, and third-party platforms, connected to the Capital Group network or used by Capital Group users or customers.

**Log** - a record of the events occurring within information systems and networks. Logs are composed of log entries; each entry contains information related to a specific event that has occurred within a system or network.

**Information** - communication or representation of knowledge such as facts, data, or opinions in any medium or form, including textual, numerical, graphic, cartographic, narrative, or audiovisual. 

**Cloud computing** - A model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

**Vulnerability**  - Weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat source. Note: The term weakness is synonymous for deficiency. Weakness may result in security and/or privacy risks.
