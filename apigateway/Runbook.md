## Overview
One of the biggest trends in application development today is the use of APIs to power the backend technologies supporting a product. Increasingly, the way mobile, IoT, web applications, or internal services talk to each other and to application frontends is using some API interface.

Alongside this trend of building API-powered applications is the move to a microservices application design pattern. A larger application is represented by many smaller application components, also typically communicating via API. The growth of APIs and microservices being used together is driven across all sorts of companies, from startups up through enterprises. The number of tools required to manage APIs at scale, securely, and with minimal operational overhead is growing as well.

**NOTE:** This document currently only pertains to *"Amazon API Gateway deployed using Private Endpoints"* and not *"Edge-Optimized API Gateway"* as these are deployed in a publically accessible model and do not adhere to CG's Cloud Security Standards.

The following NIST Controls and Subcategories are not applicable to this service:  

The following Capital Group control statements are not applicable to this service:

## Preventative Controls

### 1. API Gateway Deployed with Private Endpoints
When API gateway was originally released, the only deployment option was to deploy the API Gateway publically and fronted with CloudFront.  This deployment model does not adhere to the CG cloud security standards, specifically that all cloud resources be deployed privately with a CG internal IP address range.  Fortunatly AWS has an API Gateway offering that since 2017, has allowed one to deploy on a private VPC using Private Endpoints.  
<br>

**Below is a reference diagram of an API Gateway Private Endpoints deployment:**

<img src="/docs/img/apigw/vpcs.png" width="800"> 

<br>

**NIST CSF:** <br>

|NIST Subcategory Control|Description|
|-----------|------------------------|
|PR.PT-4|Communications and control networks are protected|
|PR.PT-5|Mechanisms (e.g., failsafe, load balancing, hot swap) are implemented to achieve resilience requirements in normal and adverse situations|
|PR.AC-3|Remote access is managed|
|PR.AC-5|Network integrity is protected (e.g., network segregation, network segmentation)|
<br>

**Capital Group:** <br>

|Control Statement|Description|
|------|----------------------|
|6|Any AWS service used by CG should not be directly available to the Internet and the default route is always the CG gateway.|
|7|Use of AWS IAM accounts are restricted to CG networks.|
<br>

**Why?**<br>
This deployment model allows the API Gateway to be only accessible by other services within the VPC and any internal services allowed through the associated Security Groups, which will be detailed later in this section.  This allows for the deployment to meet the stict CG public access policy for all cloud deployments.
<br>

**How?**<br>
Deploying an API Gateway using private Endpoints can be done by following three steps as below:

1. Creation of a VPC Endpoint

Search Endpoint Services in the AWS search bar, click on Endpoint services which should be a sub-category of VPC Services. Now click on **Create Endpoint** as seen in the screenshot below.
<br>
<img src="/docs/img/apigw/create_endpoint.png" width="800"> 
<br>

Now in the VPC Endpoint configuration use the following settings to initialize your Endpoint.
 - **Service Category:** "AWS Services"
 - **Service Name:** "com.amazonaws.{AWS region}.execute-api"
 - **VPC:** "Select the [VPC](https://github.com/open-itg/aws_runbooks/blob/master/vpc/RUNBOOK.md) in which the endpoint will reside."
 - **Enable Private DNS:** "Enabled"

<img src="/docs/img/apigw/create_endpoint_2.png" width="800"> 
<br>

The next section deals with Security Group creation and assignment.
<br>

2. Creation and attachment of a Security Group 

Once we have the initial configuration of the Endpoint, we now need to secure it with assignment of a Security Group. One can use a default Security Group, but it is a better option to create a security group for our service to limit the access to only allow CG IP's and port 443 (HTTPS) as below.

We first need to click on create security group, after the appropriate VPC has been selected.

<img src="/docs/img/apigw/sg_create.png" width="800"> 

Now we need to create a new security group with the following baseline settings, although the security group can be created with even more restricted access if company wide access is not needed.

- **Security Group Name:** "APIGWSG" or something similar.
- **Description:** "API Gateway Access for HTTPS traffic" or similar.
- **VPC:** Select the VPC that will be used for the Endpoint and API GW.
- **Inbound Rules:** Default inbound rules for API Gateway should at minimum contain the below:

<img src="/docs/img/apigw/Inbound.png" width="800"> 

- **Outbound Rules:** Default Outbound rules should reflect the minimum connectivity needed for the service to function.

<br>

3. Creation of an API Gateway
Its now time for the creation of the API Gateway itself, the pre-work done above will allow the API Gateway to be built securely for CG access only. The first step is to select the private rest API option, as this will tie into our VPC Endpoints.

<img src="/docs/img/apigw/Create_GW.png" width="800"> 
<br>

The configuration options that need to be selected are listed below:

- **New API Option:** "Selected"
- **API Name:** "An appropriate name should be assigned"
- **Description:** "An appropriate description should be assigned"
- **Endpoint Type:** "Private"
- **VPC Endpoint IDs:** "Multiple Endpoint IDs can be entered here, defending on how many subnets were selected."

### 3. Encrypt all data in the Cloud
`This Section will be updated soon.`

### 4. Deploy NLB with PrivateLink for Access to Internal Resources
API Gateway does not run on the CG Managed VPC, even when a private endpoint is used. In order to allow API Gateway to access CG internal resources (such as EC2s, EC2, or other backend resources), NLB with Private Link.

1. Go to the EC2 Console, and navigate to the Target Groups console. Create a new target group that targets either the EC2, ECS, or relevant IP address
<img src="/docs/img/apigw/targetgroup.png" width="800"> 

2. Create a new Network Load balancer targeting that group, as private network load balancer attached to the CG default vpc1
<img src="/docs/img/apigw/loadbalancersummary.png" width="800"> 

3. Go to API Gateway, and go to the 'VPC Links' and create a new VPC Link targeting that Load Balancer
<img src="/docs/img/apigw/vpclinkcreate.png" width="800"> 

### 5. Restrict Access to Deny Regions Outside US region
 *Policy resticts the access to Deny any resources outside of US Region*
