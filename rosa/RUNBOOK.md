## Overview
Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS is a managed service that's available through the AWS Management Console. It helps Red Hat OpenShift users build, scale, and manage containerized applications on AWS. With ROSA, you can create Kubernetes clusters using Red Hat OpenShift APIs and tooling and have access to the full breadth and depth of AWS services. ROSA streamlines moving on-premises Red Hat OpenShift workloads to AWS, and offers tight integration with other AWS services. With ROSA, you can access Red Hat OpenShift licensing, billing, and support all directly through AWS.

**Why?** 

Third-party human administrators have privileged back-end access to the customer environment and have the ability to modify the customer environment. Security controls will be in place to prevent all forms of unauthorized access to the customer environment.

**How?** 

SRE user access requires separated or transferred SRE accounts are removed as authorized users through an automated process. 
Additionally, the SRE performs periodic access review, including management sign-off of authorized 
user lists.

SREs generate a short-lived AWS access token using the AWS Security Token Service (STS). 
Access to the STS token is audit-logged and traceable back to individual users

Authentication requires multi-factor authentication (MFA) with
industry-standard requirements for password complexity and account lockouts

SRE adheres to the principle of least privilege when accessing Red Hat OpenShift Service 
on AWS and AWS components

SREs access private clusters using an encrypted tunnel through a hardened SRE support pod 
running in the cluster. Connections to the SRE support pod are permitted only from a secured Red 
Hat network using an IP allow-list

Red Hat does not have SRE teams in Russia, North Korea, or Iran, but one is based in Beijing.

The customer retains ownership of the AWS account and can terminate roles, policies, and 
the Private Link connection.  (This will affect Red Hat support and management of the cluster)
