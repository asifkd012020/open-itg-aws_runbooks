## Overview
Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS is a managed service that's available through the AWS Management Console. It helps Red Hat OpenShift users build, scale, and manage containerized applications on AWS. With ROSA, you can create Kubernetes clusters using Red Hat OpenShift APIs and tooling and have access to the full breadth and depth of AWS services. ROSA streamlines moving on-premises Red Hat OpenShift workloads to AWS, and offers tight integration with other AWS services. With ROSA, you can access Red Hat OpenShift licensing, billing, and support all directly through AWS.

All systems, platforms, compute instances including and not limited to physical and virtual client endpoints, physical and virtual servers, software containers, databases, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, network devices, applications (internal and external), Serverless computing instances (i.e. AWS Lambda), vendor provided appliances, and third-party platforms, connected to the Capital Group network or used by Capital Group users or customers.

**Information** - communication or representation of knowledge such as facts, data, or opinions in any medium or form, including textual, numerical, graphic, cartographic, narrative, or audiovisual. 

**Cloud computing** - A model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

**Vulnerability**  - Weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat source. Note: The term weakness is synonymous for deficiency. Weakness may result in security and/or privacy risks.
