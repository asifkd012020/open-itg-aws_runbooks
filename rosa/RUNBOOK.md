## Overview
Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS is a managed service that's available through the AWS Management Console. It helps Red Hat OpenShift users build, scale, and manage containerized applications on AWS. With ROSA, you can create Kubernetes clusters using Red Hat OpenShift APIs and tooling and have access to the full breadth and depth of AWS services. ROSA streamlines moving on-premises Red Hat OpenShift workloads to AWS, and offers tight integration with other AWS services. With ROSA, you can access Red Hat OpenShift licensing, billing, and support all directly through AWS.

## Preventative Controls

### 1. ROSA is deployed in a private VPC with DirectLink

**Capital Group Controls:** 
|Control Statement|Description|
|------|----------------------|
|[CS0012300](https://capitalgroup.service-now.com/cg_grc?sys_id=80df48c01bac20506a50beef034bcb47&table=sn_compliance_policy_statement&id=cg_grc_action_item_details&view=sp)|Cloud products and services must be deployed on private subnets and public access must be disabled for these services.|

**Why?** 

Preventing exposure to the internet access.

**How?** 

The Red Hat managed infrastructure that creates AWS PrivateLink clusters is hosted on private subnets. The connection between Red Hat and Capital Group provided infrastructure is created through PrivateLink VPC endpoints.  This configuration enables Capital Group to extend network into the cloud without exposing your network to the internet.

<img src="/docs/img/rosa/rosa-private-cluster.png" width="800">
  - *Cluster can be created without any requirements on public subnets, internet gateways, or network address translation (NAT) gateways.*

  - *In this configuration, Red Hat uses AWS PrivateLink (PrivateLink) to manage and monitor a cluster in order to avoid all public ingress network traffic.*<br>

### 2. Preventative Controls for SRE Admin Access

**Capital Group Controls:** 
|Control Statement|Description|
|------|----------------------|
|[CS0012152](https://capitalgroup.service-now.com/cg_grc?sys_id=d6df11521b5a8050da4bdca4bd4bcb48&table=sn_compliance_policy_statement&id=cg_grc_action_item_details&view=sp)|Third-party efforts must undergo data classification and risk assessments to ensure appropriate access to information systems and data.|
|[CS0012196](https://capitalgroup.service-now.com/cg_grc?sys_id=48ef15521b5a8050da4bdca4bd4bcb9a&table=sn_compliance_policy_statement&id=cg_grc_action_item_details&view=sp)|Privileged user accounts must be inventoried, associated with an owner, and each account must be approved by an authorized approver(s).|
|[CS0012177](https://capitalgroup.service-now.com/cg_grc?sys_id=4fdf51521b5a8050da4bdca4bd4bcbdb&table=sn_compliance_policy_statement&id=cg_grc_action_item_details&view=sp)|Users performing activities requiring Administrative level access must perform these activities from the designated secure administration environment.|
|[CS0012198](https://capitalgroup.service-now.com/cg_grc?sys_id=04ef15521b5a8050da4bdca4bd4bcbd5&table=sn_compliance_policy_statement&id=cg_grc_action_item_details&view=sp)|Production administrative/privileged access is only granted on an authorized temporary, on-demand basis or assigned to specifically designated user account that is separate and distinct from a non-privileged network account.|
|[CS0012199](https://capitalgroup.service-now.com/cg_grc?sys_id=0cef15521b5a8050da4bdca4bd4bcbde&table=sn_compliance_policy_statement&id=cg_grc_action_item_details&view=sp)|After being authenticated to the enterprise network, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required to utilize accounts with privileged access.|
|[CS0012190](https://capitalgroup.service-now.com/cg_grc?sys_id=e3dfd1521b5a8050da4bdca4bd4bcbad&table=sn_compliance_policy_statement&id=cg_grc_action_item_details&view=sp)|Privileged accounts are locked out after a predetermined number of consecutive failed logon attempts. (Statement of Direction)|
|[CS0012233](https://capitalgroup.service-now.com/cg_grc?sys_id=c5ef95521b5a8050da4bdca4bd4bcbf7&table=sn_compliance_policy_statement&id=cg_grc_action_item_details&view=sp)|Information systems must create a log and record activities occurring on or originating from the information system. Logs must be made accessible to the enterprise SIEM solution. (Statement of Direction)|

**Why?** 

Third-party human administrators have privileged back-end access to the customer environment and have the ability to modify the customer environment. Security controls will be in place to prevent all forms of unauthorized access to the customer environment.

**How?** 

SRE user access requires separated or transferred SRE accounts are removed as authorized users through an automated process. 
Additionally, the SRE performs periodic access review, including management sign-off of authorized 
user lists.

SREs generate a short-lived AWS access token using the AWS Security Token Service (STS). 
Access to the STS token is audit-logged and traceable back to individual users

Authentication requires multi-factor authentication (MFA) with
industry-standard requirements for password complexity and account lockouts

SRE adheres to the principle of least privilege when accessing Red Hat OpenShift Service 
on AWS and AWS components

SREs access private clusters using an encrypted tunnel through a hardened SRE support pod 
running in the cluster. Connections to the SRE support pod are permitted only from a secured Red 
Hat network using an IP allow-list

Red Hat does not have SRE teams in Russia, North Korea, or Iran, but one is based in Beijing (no support from Beijing office).

Capital Group retains ownership of the AWS account and can terminate roles, policies, and 
the Private Link connection.  (This will affect Red Hat support and management of the cluster)

### 3. Preventative Controls for SRE Admin Access (Programmatic)

**Capital Group Controls:** 
|Control Statement|Description|
|------|----------------------|
|[CS001231](https://capitalgroup.service-now.com/cg_grc?sys_id=134f8d4b1bea6850371277741a4bcbb9&table=sn_compliance_policy_statement&id=cg_grc_action_item_details&view=sp)|Services using externally exposed APIs must employ enterprise approved security mechanisms.|
|[CS0012196](https://capitalgroup.service-now.com/cg_grc?sys_id=48ef15521b5a8050da4bdca4bd4bcb9a&table=sn_compliance_policy_statement&id=cg_grc_action_item_details&view=sp)|Privileged user accounts must be inventoried, associated with an owner, and each account must be approved by an authorized approver(s).|

Logs must be made accessible to the enterprise SIEM solution. (Statement of Direction)|

**Why?** 

Third-party programmatic accounts have back-end access to the customer environment and have the ability to modify the environment.  Security controls will be in place to prevent all forms of unauthorized access to the customer environment.

**How?** 

SREs access private clusters using hardened SRE support pod running in the cluster. Connections to the SRE support pod are permitted only from a secured Red Hat network using an IP allow-list.

Programmatic access uses Kubernetes RBAC and AWS STS to achieve least privilege access.

ROSA is certified for SOC 2 Type 2, requiring the regular rotation of passwords.

Red Hat does not have SRE teams in Russia, North Korea, or Iran, but one is based in Beijing (no support from Beijing office)..

Access to systems is disabled after a specified number of unsuccessful login attempts.

Capital Group retains ownership of the AWS account and can terminate roles, policies, and the Private Link connection.  (This will affect Red Hat support and management of the cluster)

## Data Protection

### 1. Administrative session encryption

**Capital Group Controls:** 
|Control Statement|Description|
|------|----------------------|
|[CS0012261](https://capitalgroup.service-now.com/cg_grc?sys_id=efef99521b5a8050da4bdca4bd4bcb91&table=sn_compliance_policy_statement&id=cg_grc_action_item_details&view=sp)|Cloud based data in transit must be encrypted with enterprise approved algorithms.|

**Why?**

User and application sessions must be protected from unauthorized capture of data in transit.

**How?** 

All Red Hat administration communication will occur over PrivateLink using an encrypted tunnel through a hardened SRE support pod.
<br><br>


### 2. Data encryption

**Capital Group Controls:** 
|Control Statement|Description|
|------|----------------------|
|[CS0012247](https://capitalgroup.service-now.com/cg_grc?sys_id=baef59521b5a8050da4bdca4bd4bcb4a&table=sn_compliance_policy_statement&id=cg_grc_action_item_details&view=sp)|Data extraction from one source to another source or target is approved by the business data owner prior to extraction. (Statement of Direction)|

**Why?** 

Customer data may be compromised if stored in non-secured repositories.

**How?** 

Although all ROSA clusters are backed up using AWS snapshots, this does NOT include customer data stored on persistent volumes (PVs).  Additionally, ROSA uses AWS KMS to securely manage keys for encrypted data.
