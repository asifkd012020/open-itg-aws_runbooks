## Overview
Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS is a managed service that's available through the AWS Management Console. It helps Red Hat OpenShift users build, scale, and manage containerized applications on AWS. With ROSA, you can create Kubernetes clusters using Red Hat OpenShift APIs and tooling and have access to the full breadth and depth of AWS services. ROSA streamlines moving on-premises Red Hat OpenShift workloads to AWS, and offers tight integration with other AWS services. With ROSA, you can access Red Hat OpenShift licensing, billing, and support all directly through AWS.

## Cloud Security Requirements


### 1. ROSA is deployed in a private VPC with DirectLink

**Capital Group Controls:** 
|Control Statement|Description|
|------|----------------------|
|[CS0012300](https://capitalgroup.service-now.com/cg_grc?sys_id=80df48c01bac20506a50beef034bcb47&table=sn_compliance_policy_statement&id=cg_grc_action_item_details&view=sp)|Cloud products and services must be deployed on private subnets and public access must be disabled for these services.|

**Why?** 

Preventing exposure to the internet access.

**How?** 

The Red Hat managed infrastructure that creates AWS PrivateLink clusters is hosted on private subnets. The connection between Red Hat and Capital Group provided infrastructure is created through PrivateLink VPC endpoints.  This configuration enables Capital Group to extend network into the cloud without exposing your network to the internet.<br>

<img src="/docs/img/rosa/rosa-private-cluster.png" width="800">

  - *Cluster can be created without any requirements on public subnets, internet gateways, or network address translation (NAT) gateways.*
  - *In this configuration, Red Hat uses AWS PrivateLink (PrivateLink) to manage and monitor a cluster in order to avoid all public ingress network traffic.*<br>


### 2. Preventative Controls for SRE Admin Access

**Capital Group Controls:** 
|Control Statement|Description|
|------|----------------------|
|[CS0012196](https://capitalgroup.service-now.com/cg_grc?sys_id=48ef15521b5a8050da4bdca4bd4bcb9a&table=sn_compliance_policy_statement&id=cg_grc_action_item_details&view=sp)|Privileged user accounts must be inventoried, associated with an owner, and each account must be approved by an authorized approver(s).|

**Why?** 

Third-party human administrators have privileged back-end access to the customer environment and have the ability to modify the customer environment. Security controls will be in place to prevent all forms of unauthorized access to the customer environment.

**How?** 

SREs access private clusters using an encrypted tunnel through a hardened SRE support pod 
running in the cluster. Connections to the SRE support pod are permitted only from a secured Red 
Hat network using an IP allow-list

Capital Group retains ownership of the AWS account and can terminate roles, policies, and 
the Private Link connection.  (This will affect Red Hat support and management of the cluster)
<br><br>


### 3. Administrative Session Encryption

**Capital Group Controls:** 
|Control Statement|Description|
|------|----------------------|
|[CS0012261](https://capitalgroup.service-now.com/cg_grc?sys_id=efef99521b5a8050da4bdca4bd4bcb91&table=sn_compliance_policy_statement&id=cg_grc_action_item_details&view=sp)|Cloud based data in transit must be encrypted with enterprise approved algorithms.|

**Why?**

User and application sessions must be protected from unauthorized capture of data in transit.

**How?** 

All Red Hat administration communication will occur over PrivateLink using an encrypted tunnel through a hardened SRE support pod.
<br><br>


### 4. Data Encryption

**Capital Group Controls:** 
|Control Statement|Description|
|------|----------------------|
|[CS0012247](https://capitalgroup.service-now.com/cg_grc?sys_id=baef59521b5a8050da4bdca4bd4bcb4a&table=sn_compliance_policy_statement&id=cg_grc_action_item_details&view=sp)|Data extraction from one source to another source or target is approved by the business data owner prior to extraction. (Statement of Direction)|

**Why?** 

Customer data may be compromised if stored in non-secured repositories.

**How?** 

Although all ROSA clusters are backed up using AWS snapshots, this does NOT include customer data stored on persistent volumes (PVs).  Additionally, ROSA uses AWS KMS to securely manage keys for encrypted data.
<br><br>


### 5. CloudTrail Logging Enabled for ROSA and Sent to Splunk

**Capital Group Controls:** 
|Control Statement|Description|
|------|----------------------|

`This Section will be updated soon.`


### 6. Auditing Enabled for ROSA and Sent to Splunk

**Capital Group Controls:** 
|Control Statement|Description|
|------|----------------------|

`This Section will be updated soon.`

## Capital Group Glossory 
**Data** - Digital pieces of information stored or transmitted for use with an information system from which understandable information is derived. Items that could be considered to be data are: Source code, meta-data, build artifacts, information input and output.  
 
**Information System** - An organized assembly of resources and procedures for the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information. All systems, platforms, compute instances including and not limited to physical and virtual client endpoints, physical and virtual servers, software containers, databases, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, network devices, applications (internal and external), Serverless computing instances (i.e. AWS Lambda), vendor provided appliances, and third-party platforms, connected to the Capital Group network or used by Capital Group users or customers.

**Log** - a record of the events occurring within information systems and networks. Logs are composed of log entries; each entry contains information related to a specific event that has occurred within a system or network.

**Information** - communication or representation of knowledge such as facts, data, or opinions in any medium or form, including textual, numerical, graphic, cartographic, narrative, or audiovisual. 

**Cloud computing** - A model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

**Vulnerability**  - Weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat source. Note: The term weakness is synonymous for deficiency. Weakness may result in security and/or privacy risks.
