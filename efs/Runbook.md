## Overview
Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) provides a simple, serverless, set-and-forget, elastic file system that lets you share file data without provisioning or managing storage. It can be used with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources, and is built to scale on demand to petabytes without disrupting applications.

Amazon EFS is well suited to support a broad spectrum of use cases from home directories to business-critical applications. Use cases include storage for containerized and serverless applications, big data analytics, web serving and content management, application development and testing, media and entertainment workflows, and database backups.

## Preventative Controls

### 1. EFS Utilizes VPC Endpoints to Prevent Public Access
AWS EFS currently supports VPC Interface Endpoints, and as such allows the service to meet CG's stringent Public Access control requirements.
<br>

**NIST CSF:** <br>

|NIST Subcategory Control|Description|
|-----------|------------------------|
|PR.PT-4|Communications and control networks are protected|
|PR.PT-5|Mechanisms (e.g., failsafe, load balancing, hot swap) are implemented to achieve resilience requirements in normal and adverse situations|
|PR.AC-3|Remote access is managed|
|PR.AC-5|Network integrity is protected (e.g., network segregation, network segmentation)|
<br>

**Capital Group:** <br>

|Control Statement|Description|
|------|----------------------|
|6|Any AWS service used by CG should not be directly available to the Internet and the default route is always the CG gateway.|
|7|Use of AWS IAM accounts are restricted to CG networks.|
<br>

**Why?**<br>
EFS is a service that allows for the storage and processing of data on AWS Services such as EC2, Fargate etc. Due to the possibility of sensitive data being stored and processed through EFS, We need to make sure that this traffic is not transmitted directly over the Public Internet. 
<br>

**How?**<br>
Establishing a private connection between your virtual private cloud (VPC) and the Amazon EFS API, you should create an interface VPC endpoint. You can use this connection to call the Amazon EFS API from your VPC without sending traffic over the Internet. The endpoint provides secure connectivity to the Amazon EFS API without requiring an Internet gateway (IGW), NAT instance, or virtual private network (VPN) connection.

Interface VPC endpoints are powered by AWS PrivateLink, a feature that enables private communication between AWS services using private IP addresses. To use AWS PrivateLink, create an interface VPC endpoint for Amazon EFS in your VPC using the Amazon VPC console, API, or CLI. Doing this creates an elastic network interface in your subnet with a private IP address that serves Amazon EFS API requests. You can also access a VPC endpoint from on-premises environments or from other VPCs using AWS VPN, AWS Direct Connect, or VPC peering. Below are the steps to implement Interface VPC Endpoints for EFS:

**Creation of Interface VPC Endpoint**
  1. Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/, and choose Endpoints from the navigation pane at left.
  2. Choose Create Endpoint.
     - For Service category, choose AWS service. 
     - For Service Name, choose Config in your AWS Region (for example, `com.amazonaws.us-east-1.elasticfilesystem`).
     - Then choose the VPC, if it does not already exist follow this [link](https://github.com/open-itg/aws_runbooks/blob/master/vpc/RUNBOOK.md) for instructions on how to create a new VPC. 
     - Select a security group for AWS Config, if the default security group will not suffice then follow this [link](https://github.com/open-itg/aws_runbooks/blob/master/vpc/RUNBOOK.md) for instructions on how to create a new Security Group. 
     - Make sure that you `Enable` the Enable Private DNS Name check box.
     - Now add the appropriate `CG standard tags`.
  4. Click `Create Endpoint` to complete the process.
  <br>

**Creating an Interface VPC Endpoint Policy**

Controling access to the Amazon EFS API is a must to comply with CG's standards of providing least priviledge access. You can attach an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy to your VPC endpoint and allows for granular permissions control. 

The policy specifies the following:
 - The principal that can perform actions.
 - The actions that can be performed.
 - The resources on which actions can be performed

**Example Policy:**<br>
   The following example shows a VPC endpoint policy that denies everyone permission to create an EFS file system through the endpoint. The example policy also grants everyone permission to perform all other actions.

```
{
   "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": "*",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "*",
            "Principal": "*"
        },
        {
            "Action": "elasticfilesystem:CreateFileSystem",
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Resource": "*",
            "Principal": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

### 7. Restrict Access to Deny Regions Outside US region
 *Policy resticts the access to Deny any resources outside of US Region*
 ```
 {
            "Sid": "DenyAllOutsideUS",
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "NotAction": [
                "support:*",
                "sts:*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringNotEquals": {
                    "aws:RequestedRegion": [
                        "us-west-1",
                        "us-west-9",
                        "us-east-1",
                    ]
                },
                "StringNotLike": {
                    "aws:PrincipalArn": [
                        "arn:aws:iam::*:role/OrganizationAccountAccessRole"
                    ]
                }
            }
