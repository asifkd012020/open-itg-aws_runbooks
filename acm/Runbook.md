## Overview
AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) handles the complexity of creating, storing, and renewing public and private SSL/TLS X.509 certificates and keys that protect your AWS websites and applications. You can provide certificates for your integrated AWS services either by issuing them directly with ACM or by importing third-party certificates into the ACM management system. ACM certificates can secure singular domain names, multiple specific domain names, wildcard domains, or combinations of these. ACM wildcard certificates can protect an unlimited number of subdomains. You can also export ACM certificates signed by ACM Private CA for use anywhere in your internal PKI.

**NOTE:** This document currently only pertains to the "Amazon Certificate Management (ACM)" service and not the "ACM Private CA" service offering.

The following NIST Controls and Subcategories are not applicable to this service:  

The following Capital Group control statements are not applicable to this service:

## Preventative Controls
<img src="/docs/img/Prevent.png" width="50">

### 1. IAM Users and Roles Enforce Least Priviledge
AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) as with many AWS PaaS services by nature do not usually allow for the service to be built within a Private VPC, and therefore Identity and Access Management (IAM) controls may be the only true option for securing access to the service and the data stored within.
<br>

**NIST CSF:** <br>

|NIST Subcategory Control|Description|
|-----------|------------------------|
|PR.AC-1|Identities and credentials are issued, managed, verified, revoked, and audited for authorized devices, users and processes|
|PR.AC-4|Access permissions and authorizations are managed, incorporating the principles of least privilege and separation of duties|
|PR.AC-7|Users, devices, and other assets are authenticated (e.g., single-factor, multi-factor) commensurate with the risk of the transaction (e.g., individuals’ security and privacy risks and other organizational risks)|
|PR.PT-3|The principle of least functionality is incorporated by configuring systems to provide only essential capabilities|
<br>

**Capital Group:** <br>

|Control Statement|Description|
|------|----------------------|
|5|AWS IAM User accounts are only to be created for use by services or products that do not support IAM Roles. Services are not allowed to create local accounts for human use within the service. All human user authentication will take place within CG’s Identity Provider.|
|8|AWS IAM User secrets, including passwords and secret access keys, are to be rotated every 90 days. Accounts created locally within any service must also have their secrets rotated every 90 days.|
|10|Administrative access to AWS resources will have MFA enabled|
<br>

**Why?**<br>
ACM is used to generate and store both Digital Certificates and the associated Private Keys used for validation and encryption of the company's most important applications and services. Due to the sensitive nature of this data one needs to implement levels of privilege and have authorization mechanisms in place to enforce the separation of privileges, and mandate multi-factor authentication or similar protections based on sensitivity.
<br>

**How?**<br>
1. Use IAM for appropriate user access restrictions
2. Access to the certificate key materials are allowed following the least privilege access model.

AWS managed policies are standalone identity-based policies that you can attach to multiple users, groups, and roles in your AWS account. AWS managed policies are created and managed by AWS. ACM also provides the ability to use Customer Managed policies, if one needs more granular access control policy, but for most of CG's accounts in AWS the Managed Policies will suffice. The following AWS managed policies are available for ACM:

**AWSCertificateManagerReadOnly**<br>
This role will allow a user read-only access to the ACM service, and will provide sufficient rights to pull and use a certificate for other services in AWS.

```
{
   "Version":"2012-10-17",
   "Statement":{
      "Effect":"Allow",
      "Action":[
         "acm:DescribeCertificate",
         "acm:ListCertificates",
         "acm:GetCertificate",
         "acm:ListTagsForCertificate"
      ],
      "Resource":"*"
   }
}
```

**AWSCertificateManagerFullAccess**<br>
This role will allow a user full administrative access to the ACM service, including the rights to delete certificates, and as such this role should only be assigned to administrators of the service. The policy statement below can be used to create the role.

```
{
   "Version":"2012-10-17",
   "Statement":[
      {
         "Effect":"Allow",
         "Action":[
            "acm:*"
         ],
         "Resource":"*"
      },
      {
         "Effect":"Allow",
         "Action":"iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole",
         "Resource":"arn:aws:iam::*:role/aws-service-role/acm.amazonaws.com/AWSServiceRoleForCertificateManager*",
         "Condition":{
            "StringEquals":{
               "iam:AWSServiceName":"acm.amazonaws.com"
            }
         }
      },
      {
         "Effect":"Allow",
         "Action":[
            "iam:DeleteServiceLinkedRole",
            "iam:GetServiceLinkedRoleDeletionStatus",
            "iam:GetRole"
         ],
         "Resource":"arn:aws:iam::*:role/aws-service-role/acm.amazonaws.com/AWSServiceRoleForCertificateManager*"
      }
   ]
}
```


### 2. Encrypt all data in the Cloud

**NIST CSF:** <br>
|NIST Subcategory Control|Description|
|-----------|------------------------|
|PR.DS-1|Data-at-rest is protected|
|PR.DS-2|Data-in-transit is protected|
|PR.DS-5|Protections against data leaks are implemented|
|PR.DS-6|Integrity checking mechanisms are used to verify software, firmware, and information integrity|
|PR.IP-1|A baseline configuration of information technology/industrial control systems is created and maintained incorporating security principles (e.g. concept of least functionality)|

**Capital Group:** <br>
|Control Statement|Description|
|------|----------------------|
|1|All Data-at-rest must be encrypted and use a CG BYOK encryption key.|
|2|All Data-in-transit must be encrypted using certificates using CG Certificate Authority.|
|3|Keys storied in a Key Management System (KMS) should be created by Capital Group's hardware security module (HSM) and are a minimum of AES-256.|
<br>

**Why?**<br>

**How?**<br>
1. Encryption keys, Private Keys and Digital Certificates will be managed by CG
2. Encryption of all data in transit using TLS 1.2 or higher

### 3. Certificate Best Practices Used
**NIST CSF:**

**Capital Group:**

**Why?**<br>

**How?**<br>
1. No Self-Signed
2. No Wildcard Certs
3. Certificate Pinning
4. Certificate Removal for Old / Unsused

## Detective Controls
<img src="/docs/img/Detect.png" width="50">

### 1. Certificate Resources are tagged according to CG standards

### 2. CloudWatch logging enabled and sent to Splunk

## Capital Group Glossory 
**Data** - Digital pieces of information stored or transmitted for use with an information system from which understandable information is derived. Items that could be considered to be data are: Source code, meta-data, build artifacts, information input and output.  
 
**Information System** - An organized assembly of resources and procedures for the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information. All systems, platforms, compute instances including and not limited to physical and virtual client endpoints, physical and virtual servers, software containers, databases, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, network devices, applications (internal and external), Serverless computing instances (i.e. AWS Lambda), vendor provided appliances, and third-party platforms, connected to the Capital Group network or used by Capital Group users or customers.

**Log** - a record of the events occurring within information systems and networks. Logs are composed of log entries; each entry contains information related to a specific event that has occurred within a system or network.

**Information** - communication or representation of knowledge such as facts, data, or opinions in any medium or form, including textual, numerical, graphic, cartographic, narrative, or audiovisual. 

**Cloud computing** - A model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

**Vulnerability**  - Weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat source. Note: The term weakness is synonymous for deficiency. Weakness may result in security and/or privacy risks.
