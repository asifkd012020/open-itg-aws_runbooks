## Overview
Amazon QuickSight is a cloud-scale business intelligence (BI) service that you can use to deliver easy-to-understand insights to the people who you work with, wherever they are. Amazon QuickSight connects to your data in the cloud and combines data from many different sources. In a single data dashboard, QuickSight can include AWS data, third-party data, big data, spreadsheet data, SaaS data, B2B data, and more. As a fully managed cloud-based service, Amazon QuickSight provides enterprise-grade security, global availability, and built-in redundancy. 

Amazon QuickSight enables you to manage your users and content using a comprehensive set of security features. These include role-based access control, Microsoft Active Directory integration, AWS CloudTrail auditing, single sign-on using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) and third-party solutions, private VPC subnets, and data backup. Amazon QuickSight security features, if implemented correctly will allow the service to meet Capital Groups current security standards and expectations for Cloud based services.

The following NIST Controls and Subcategories are not applicable to this service:

## Preventative Controls
<img src="/docs/img/Prevent.png" width="50">

### 1. IAM roles defined following least privilege model
**NIST CSF:**
|NIST Subcategory Control|Description|
|-----------|------------------------|
|PR.AC-1|Identities and credentials are issued, managed, verified, revoked, and audited for authorized devices, users and processes|
|PR.AC-3|Remote Access is managed|
|PR.AC-4|Access permissions and authorizations are managed, incorporating the principles of least privilege and separation of duties|
|PR.AC-6|Identities are proofed and bound to credentials and asserted in interactions|
|PR.PT-3|The principle of least frunctionality is incorporated by configuring systems to rpovide only essential capabilities|

**Capital Group:**
|Control Statement|Description|
|------|----------------------|
|8|Local IAM secrets are rotated every 90 days, including accounts IaaS resources.

### 2. Disable Internet (public) access

NIST CSF:
|NIST Subcategory Control|Description|
|-----------|------------------------|
|PR.PT-4|Communications and control networks are protected|
|PR.AC-5|Network integrity is protected (e.g., network segregation, network segmentation)|

Capital Group:
|Control Statement|Description|
|------|----------------------|
|6|Any AWS service used by CG should not be directly available to the Internet and the default route is always the CG gateway.|
|7|Use of AWS IAM accounts are restricted to CG networks.|

### 3. Encrypt data at rest using CG KMS
Supports Record Level encryption and can be assigned by IAM Role

NIST CSF:
|NIST Subcategory Control|Description|
|-----------|------------------------|
|PR.DS-1|Data-at-rest is protected|

Capital Group:
|Control Statement|Description|
|------|----------------------|
|1|All Data-at-rest must be encrypted and use a CG BYOK encryption key.|
|2|Keys storied in a Key Management System (KMS) should be created by Capital Group's hardware security module (HSM) and are a minimum of AES-256.|

### 4. Encrypt data in transit using TLS 1.2

NIST CSF:
|NIST Subcategory Control|Description|
|-----------|------------------------|
|PR.DS-2|Data-in-transit is protected|

Capital Group:
|Control Statement|Description|
|------|----------------------|
|1|All Data-in-transit must be encrypted using certificates using CG Certificate Authority.|

### 5. Record Level Encryption

NIST CSF:
|NIST Subcategory Control|Description|
|-----------|------------------------|
|PR.DS-1|Data-at-rest is protected|

Capital Group:
|Control Statement|Description|
|------|----------------------|
|1|All Data-at-rest must be encrypted and use a CG BYOK encryption key.|
|2|Keys storied in a Key Management System (KMS) should be created by Capital Group's hardware security module (HSM) and are a minimum of AES-256.|
