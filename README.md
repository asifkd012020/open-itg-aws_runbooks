# aws_runbooks
AWS runbooks deliver a set of consumable and repeatable templates for teams to use when deploying various AWS resources that will ensure services are secured from deployment and during life of the service. The runbooks will be built off of playbooks that align with NIST Cyber Security Frame work and establish guardrails for teams to develop the runbooks.
